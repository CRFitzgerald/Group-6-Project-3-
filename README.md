What Makes Books Best: Visualizing Amazonâ€™s Best Books of 2022

In our project, we plan on using beautifulsoup as our primary method of collecting data on 100 books that Amazon ranks as Best of 2022. We will visualize this data to provide meaningful insights using JavaScript.

# Requirements:
1. Visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2. Project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
3. Project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
4. Project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
5. The final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

# Top 10 books based on rating:
