       "  'reviews': [\"This book is like quicksand. It will suck you in and not let go until you finish it. Oh, it is GOOD!Written by Bonnie Garmus, this is a novel that is both a riveting story and a feminist manifesto. It's 1952 and Elizabeth Zott, a brilliant wannabe chemist, is being stifled at every turn, prevented from getting a Ph.D. (and when you find out the reason, you will want to throw something) and unable to find a job suitable for her genius mind. She is forced to settle. Working at Hastings Research Institute in the fictional town of Commons, California as the only female scientist, she spends her days fighting obstacle after obstacle. Then she meets Calvin Evans, the boy genius who is a celebrity in the world of chemistry. The two fall deeply, soulfully in love. Each comes from a tragic background, and they truly find solace in one another until yet another tragedy happens. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is pregnant, which causes her to be summarily fired from her job. Madeline is born, and after a series of missteps, Elizabeth becomes an unlikely TV star, hosting a live afternoon cooking show in which she teaches her largely female audience not only what to make for dinner, but also the chemical reactions involved. And the underlying message of each show, in addition to the chemistry lesson, is the extraordinary value of women—even though in the early 1960s, many women felt they were valued only as glorified maids. Add to the mix an assortment of delightful minor characters and a charming dog named Six-Thirty.Ingeniously plotted with big, bold, and delightfully quirky characters, an enchanting love story, and a resounding, insightful message, this is a book to be savored and recommended to your best friends.I hope a lot of young women—those in their late teens and early 20s—read this book so they will appreciate how far women have come and what it (really) was like not that long ago.Bonus: There are parts of this novel that are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Of course, other parts will make you weep. Kind of perfect!\",\n",
       "   \"Strongly recommend for anyone looking for a compelling character driven story set in the early 60's. Elizabeth is a scientist and chemist denied her right to work in the science field. It's the late 1950's and women were wives and mothers not scientists. She is an unmarried single mother and an unapologetic atheist. Her soulmate Calvin is a brilliant scientist who takes her work seriously and they have a child together. Calvin dies young in a freak accident and the unscrupulous CEO of their company fires Elizabeth who  then makes a meager living helping male scientists with their work. She is uncredited of course but by a  fluke takes a job at a local tv show preparing meals. In her unique way of infusing chemistry lessons with cooking lessons she becomes very popular and uses her platform to expose the inequality and sexism of its time. She uses her scientific mind to dissect religion too. Her dog is smart and she teachers him over 900 words. Her daughter Mad is mature beyond her years. There is so much in this book I can't review it all. Except to say I really loved this book. Bonnie Gamus takes on the Catholic Church, sexism, inequality, the media and journalism and even public school education.  I loved this book. I read it in three days.\",\n",
       "   'Lessons in Chemistry is a very clever novel about a woman’s struggle in an age of inequality, to be seen as an equal. That just because she was born a woman doesn’t mean that her life’s purpose is to serve men. Elizabeth is much too clever to let misogyny and gender create her identity. Reading this novel, I realized how fortunate I was that my entry into the workplace wasn’t filled with men who were trying to hold me down, and that I lived in an age, while not equal was at least not filled with illegal actions. In Elizabeth Gott’s world she wasn’t quite as fortunate.I was so interested in Elizabeth’s persona. She wasn’t your average woman, in fact her intellect was way above average, a fact that her boyfriend and lover Calvin Evans found very attractive. I found her fight for independence and equality interesting despite that fight putting her at odds with happiness in love. Poor Calvin was ecstatic to have this amazing, beautiful woman as his, yet she was so untraditional that she’d never let him put a ring on her finger. It made for a really interesting reading! When she was cast as the chef on tv, her life views horrified her bosses, yet found an audience with the women of America. She was such an interesting character!This novel had a little bit of everything. There was a hint of romance, but it was Elizabeth’s fighting spirit that drew me to keep turning the pages. Elizabeth’s voice was strange and wonderful, and despite my living in a world where equality is much closer to reality, I looked forward to reading how Elizabeth would out smart and out fight the men who lived in the world around her.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['I loved everything about this book…It’s adorable, sweet, sad, theatrical, character-collaborative-driven-in-spirit, artful, smart, emotional, intellectually rigorous, perceptive, and wonderful…I could name a dozen more vertiginously exciting . . . vibrant wordsto reflect the deep satisfying experience this novel is.Even at oddball moments, Gabrielle Zevin’s novel flourishes surprising wisdom touching on the most common elements of the heart…..with unforgettable indelible characters.In totality…….IT’S ALL BRILLIANT!…..and VERY ENJOYABLE!!!  ….the writing, narrative, structure, (the gaming), the characters: (major and minor), and their relationships are LOVABLE as can be….Sadie (Jewish-American) was one of the most brilliant people that Sam (American, part Korean and part Jewish descent) knew.He hadn’t seen her in years—until he did—since their childhood in Southern California. Sadie went to MITSam went to Harvard…..[Sam’s roommate-Marx- is a crucial part of the story, too]…Other favorite characters are *grandparents*…  GOTTA LOVE the generations — of love….The context themes of love, loss, and life tragedies, are captured with sincerity, depth, and honesty.This book could only have been written by somebody who has experienced grief to great lengths.  Zevin has an impressive imagination  and proficient talent…..leaving us readers with a memorable feat of storytelling, fine prose, and heartbreaking real characters.I was one of those readers who fell in love with her novel “The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry”…..(It wasn’t too ‘sappy’ for me as it was for a few of my friends), but THIS….”Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow”…..is more sophisticated….more fully developed….Zevin is in her prime with this novel….  ……I can’t imagine any reader ‘disliking’ it…..There is something for everyone….many issues to contemplate!!!!  …..an examination of very profound friendships—The ‘relationship-complex-love-friendship-issues’ were  masterfully explored.The brilliance shines throughout……  ….with a look at the effects of tragedies, violence, illness, death, parents, grandparents, feelings of loneliness, fitting in, admiration for gaming designers….(especially women in the profession)…love for people, love for one another, and an enhanced respect for the benefits of gaming ……About the aspects of ‘gaming’ ….  …..NOBODY NEEDS TO BE DIRECTLY interested….But……I realized by the end of this novel (after tearful melancholy feelings), that there are benefits from gaming….They ‘really’ must improved cognitive abilities, improved problem-solving skills and logic….BECAUSE….  …..the characters in this novel (who played and created these games) WERE able to apply their technical skills to their relationships.  It was subtle—but not-not unnoticed.So…..parents: I wouldn’t worry if you can’t get your kid to stop playing games too much.  It’s amazing how much they are learning about life….in relationship to others.One more thing I must say …..then I’ll leave a few excerpts…I thought the very beginning was MASTERFULLY written.  I can’t remember ever reading a book that pointed to the ‘past, present, and the future’ at the same time more magnificently. SO WELL DONE!!!Ok….enough of my excitement….Here are some excerpts:  “Before Mazer invented himself as Mazer, he was Samson Mazer, and before he was Samson Mazer, he was Samson Mazur—a change of two letters that transformed him from a nice ostensibly jewish boy to a Professional Builder of Worlds— and for most of his youth he was Sam—S.A.M. on the hall of fame of his grandfather’s ‘Donkey Kong’ machine, but mainly Sam”.NOTE: the above excerpt— written at the start- is worth reading a few times.  (IMO)….then let it go…..it will show up in different ways through the rest of the novel.  “Sadie! SADIE! He felt foolish. SADIE MIRANDA GREEN! YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!”  “Finally, she turned. She scanned the crowd slowly and when she spotted Sam, the smile spread over her face like a time-lapse video he had once seen in a high school physics class of a rose in bloom. It was beautiful, Sam thought, and perhaps, he worried, a tad ersatz. She walked over to him, still smiling—one dimple on her right cheek, an almost imperceptibly wider gap between the two middle teeth on top—and he thought that the crowd seemed to part for her, in a way that the world never moved for him”.  “It’s my sister who died of dysentery, Sam Masur, Sadie said. I died of exhaustion, following a snakebite”.  “And of not wanting to shoot the bison, Sam said”.  “It’s wasteful. All that meat just rots”.  “Sadie through her arms around him. Sam Masur! I kept hoping I’d run into you”.  “What brings you to Harvard Square? Sam asked”.  “Why the Magic Eye, of course, she said playfully. She gestured in front of her, toward the advertisement. For the first time, Sam registered the 60-by-40-inch poster that transformed commuters into zombie horde”.  “SEE THE WORLD IN A WHOLE NEW WAY. THIS CHRISTMAS, THE GIFT EVERYONE WANTS IS THE MAGIC EYE”.Sadie….with thoseheterochromic eyes…..  “In which case, the only proper thing for us to do right now is have coffee, Sam said. Or whatever you drink, if coffee’s too much of a cliché for you. Chai tea. Matcha. Snapple. Champagne. There’s a world with infinite beverage possibilities, right over our heads, you know? All we have to do is ride that escalator and it’s hours for the partaking”.  “If this were a game, he could hit pause. He could restart, say different things, the right one’s this time. He could search his inventory for the item that would make Sadie not leave”.  “You would think women would want to stick together when there weren’t many of them, but they never did. It was as if being a woman was a disease that you didn’t wish to catch. As long as you didn’t associate with the other women, you could imply to the majority, the men: ‘I’m not like those other ones’. Sadie was, by nature, a loner, but even she found going to MIT in a female body to be an isolating experience. The year Sadie was admitted to MIT, women were slightly over a third of her class, but somehow, it felt like even less than that. Sadie sometimes felt as if she could go weeks without seeing a woman. It might have been that the men, most of them at least, assumed you were stupid if you were a woman”.“What is a game? … It’s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It’s a possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever”.Wonderful….as wonderful as can be!!!elysejody',\n",
       "   'It has been a long time since a book has left me as mesmerized and energized as this one, and a long time since I’ve felt compelled to write a book review.Which is to say , Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow is that kind of a book , a fantastic book. A book that leaves you wanting to do something , to be someone , just beyond the horizon of your own predictability.It is the sort of book that lingers on your lap for some time after you’ve turned the last page, makes you want to clear your morning schedule after you’ve been up all night reading, just to  spend a little more time luxuriating in Zevin’s  infinite world of possibility. Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow is the kind of book that makes zealots of complacent readers and idolaters of aspiring and established writers alike.I will admit, I was in no way drawn to the premise of this book. I have no interest in gaming. Or programming. In fact , this 400 page novel, ostensibly about three Harvard and MIT educated video game programmers, sat on my nightstand looking pretty for about a month. And it would have ended there except I’m an aesthete by nature, and it really was pretty. So it could not go ignored for too long. The cover is a work of art in and of itself. Psychedelic Tomorrows appear like scratchboard art etchings, suspended against a  “storm tossed sea”- the iconic Great Wave off Kanagawa originally fashioned in 1831 by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.And while they say you shouldn’t judge a book by it’s cover , in this case , you would be wise to do just that. TTT is not just a book about gaming. Yes it’s the story of three programmers coming together to build something that will come to define a generation. But it’s more than that. It’s a book about coming together to build something that is more  than the sum of its parts. A book about friendship, ambition, disability, and triumph and all the different kinds of love you will inevitability experience along the way.Zevin’s world is a physical world but also a digital one, a world of infinite possibilities. A where players can be reborn  and cheat death a thousand times. A place where disability won’t impede your ability to soar to new horizons. Or to craft those horizons.Her characters are unforgettable. All MIT and Harvard prodigies in their own rights, we have Sam, a disabled Jewish-Korean orphan, Sadie, an Ashkenazi California native and Sam’s childhood best friend, business partner and fellow gamer. And there’s Marx, a Korean Zac Morris of sorts whose effortless beauty,  generosity, and charisma often obscure the fact that he is as brilliant and creative as his quirkier tech-centric peers. In the 400 beautifully written pages of Zevin’s latest novel , These characters come together to form one of the strangest and most beautiful love stories you’ll come across in modern day literature. Friendship,as it turns out —-may be the greatest love of all.I won’t say more . At a certain point . You have to let the work speak for itself .Five stars']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['Demon Copperhead. Holy moley, what a book. It\\'s one of those books I made myself put down just because I didn\\'t want to finish it too soon. At the same time, it\\'s one I probably wouldn\\'t have read at all, except that a friend recommended it, based on the fact that one of my own writing projects is dealing with some of the same themes. That, plus its connection to David Copperfield and the almost lyrical prose of the free sample chapters, convinced me to pay the exorbitant-for-Kindle price of the whole book.Well, I\\'m glad I did. Demon Copperhead is one of those books that gets in your head and stays stuck there until you finish and even afterward. Your pages turn a mile a minute because not only do you want the characters to be okay, you want to know what happens. You want to see Demon and his compatriots either triumph over their hardships or, if they choose a path that won\\'t end there, at least get to an ending that makes sense and leaves a logical and lasting impression. Which in both cases, oh boy, do they. These characters don\\'t just feel like real people, they are real. I know I say that a lot, but man! I was not one of them; I was your classic straight-A, straight edge student who went home to stable parents every night. But I knew these kids existed. I lived (still live) in a town with problems and stories similar to Lee County\\'s. I didn\\'t have the same problems or story as Demon, but straight A\\'s and straight edge or not, I had my own reasons for being, let\\'s say, in the \"orphan class\" of my circle. Like Demon, I spent a lot of years feeling like I had a lot of shine, but if it came off, people would see coal underneath and be repulsed.Beyond that, Barbara Kingsolver just plain nailed these characters, these settings, this life story of her modern, Appalachian David Copperfield. I not only felt for, but felt with and not only traveled with, but traveled inside, Demon all the way from his home next door to the Peggott\\'s, to Creaky\\'s farm, to the McCobb\\'s, to Coach Winfield\\'s and everywhere in between. I can\\'t say every place and character was one I grew to love. I mean, come on, some of these people are downright cruel or downright creeps. But, they were three-dimensional and I could at least understand them. And even the situations and scenes at which I cringed, left an impression on me. Special mention goes to:-The Squadron at Creaky Farm. Every kid needs a friend like Tommy, I don\\'t care who or how old you are. And as dysfunctional as the Squadron was, I got behind the brotherhood. I\\'ve written situations and characters like that, not as well as Barbara has, I\\'ll grant you. The commitment to survival, the heart, the unbroken spirits, will do something to you.-Demon\\'s developing drawing talent and cartoons. I loved seeing those, from his first superhero drawings all the way up to the Red Neck comic strip. I kept thinking, how would he draw me? And I loved how Barbara gave this resilient, rough-edged character an artistic, soft side without making him a stereotypical beta male or heaven forbid, what folks in Appalachia might think of as a sissy.-Mr. Armstrong and Ms. Annie, of course. Not just because they\\'re \"good teachers trying to save the poor foster kid,\" either, which I\\'ve seen done and done poorly. No, you get the sense they\\'re learning and growing right alongside Demon, making their own mistakes and learning how to save up and give away their own juice. Plus, I absolutely loved Mr. Armstrong\\'s way of showing his students their history and how it has contributed to their current poverty, educational lack, drug-related temptations, \"and etc.\"-Angus Winfield, oh my gosh, I just love her to bits. She is the coolest and least stereotypical high school student you\\'d ever want to meet. If we were in high school together, we might\\'ve blown each other off, but I\\'d like to think we could\\'ve been friends. Maybe we would\\'ve reluctantly partnered for one of those stupid Antarctica projects and laughed over the fact that Bettina Cook thought penguins lived with Santa at the North Pole.Aside from settings and characters, Barbara also nailed her themes. As mentioned, the one that sticks with me the most is the history, present situation, and future outlook for the kids of Appalachia, especially considering the current prescription drug situation. Now again, I was not one of those kids and am not one of those adults. But, having lived with cerebral palsy from birth, having gotten nothing but the runaround and the \"we give up, you\\'re too \\'high-functioning\\'\" from those who should\\'ve fallen all over themselves to help--yeah, I got Demon\\'s frustrations, from a different place. It\\'s no picnic when over 90% of your income comes from a government check--and that\\'s *with* four-year college, Aunt June. So yeah, I was with Mr. Armstrong, and Ms. Annie, and Angus. Wake up, stupid school board, napping principal, whoever. Get off your butt and give these kids a future, even if it has to start with one little academic team. Wake up, medical system, one kid\\'s overdosed mom oughta be enough to make you think, what\\'s going on with these prescription drugs? Wake up, social services, what part of filthy farmhouse, slave labor, and flat broke family with four kids under seven don\\'t you *get?*The other themes, especially resilience, jump off the page, too. I rooted for Demon the whole time because, as Mr. Armstrong says, he is the driver. He walked out of the major car wreck, not once, but many times. Sometimes I cringed at his naivete, as with the original David Copperfield, especially when it came to Emmy and particularly Dori (who I felt sorry for, but my Lord)! But pair that resilience with the darker side of the human condition, such as which lives get celebrated and which lives just get the casket lid closed on them, and it shines all the brighter.Several scenes \"popped\" all over the book, so many it would take too much time to enumerate them all. And some I can\\'t tell you about without spoiling the ending, although the ending is that little bit of hope and happiness I hung on for. And you *do* have to hang on, through a lot. One reason I took a star is sheer length. This thing is a doorstop. Now, that\\'s not a problem on its own. Barbara Kingsolver is kinda known for doorstops. But it doesn\\'t work as well here as I\\'ve seen her work with it, because what you have with this book is Demon\\'s entire, literal life story. For me personally, there were a few times where I asked myself, \"Do I really need all this?\" And there were times where Demon seemed to relive versions of the same kind of experience. I felt like, \"Okay, I\\'ve seen this once and it was powerful enough that I think we can move on.\"I also took a star because, as much as I loved all these characters, sometimes they crowded the stage. Sometimes there\\'d be characters in a scene or an arc who I didn\\'t think needed to be there. I completely understood Barbara\\'s desire to make Lee County one of those places where you keep coming back and you keep running into people you knew and they in turn touch your life again. It happens, I should know. But truth is stranger than fiction, and in fiction, all these people popping in and out just cramps the book\\'s style. Some characters, like Tommy and Fast Forward, it works for. Others it\\'s like, \"Okay, move along.\"Perhaps this is why I thought a few threads weren\\'t developed at the pace they should\\'ve been. For instance, Fast Forward is a monster and I\\'m totally behind that. And you do see hints of his true character throughout the novel, like at Creaky Farm. But he\\'s in and out of the story so much that the actual revelation of how deep Fast Forward\\'s problems go--well, it works, but it also feels a bit out of left field. The same is true for Betsy\\'s thread, in that yeah, I buy Demon having a grandma he doesn\\'t meet until he\\'s twelve, and I buy her not wanting to be in his life. But then, as Angus says, her desire to basically take over makes no sense.Finally, yes. I did take off points for language. That\\'s not because I can\\'t \"handle\" it. I\\'m an adult, for goodness\\' sakes. But the near-constant F-bombs just got on my nerves after a while because, just, really? And as you might know, the misuse of Jesus\\' name is a very personal pet peeve. Now, I\\'m sure Jesus Himself had to tell His disciples to clean up their language now and again, especially Peter. And it\\'s my personal theory that our beloved St. Paul had a potty mouth, at least to a point. But it does wear on you. So, not a major issue for adult readers, but if it\\'s not your thing, caveat emptor. And yeah, I\\'d say don\\'t give this one to your teen, it\\'s got some pretty heavy depictions of addiction in it, as well as a couple of sex scenes I freely admit I skimmed.All that aside though, I don\\'t regret spending a minute with Demon Copperhead. He is a perfect modern David Copperfield, he got me thinking, and in a weird way, yeah, the book blessed me. It inspired me to keep writing. And I\\'m willing to bet it will stir something new and unique inside you, too. Mature readers, grab a copy and savor. There\\'s redemption to be had if you\\'re looking.',\n",
       "   'When, at the age of 15, I first read David Copperfield, Charles Dickens’ classic novel of the protagonist’s struggle to rise above child poverty in a society seemingly structured to keep him poor, it was the first book that made me tear up at the end, that glorious end with the angelic Agnes ever “pointing upward.” I wasn’t sure that Barbara Kingsolver’s DemonCopperhead could possibly elicit anything like that response from my jaded, seen-it-all-before, read-it-all-before consciousness. Re-imagining the quintessentially British Dickens’ nineteenth-century story as a twenty-first century slice of American Appalachian life? How’s that likely to work?Well, of course, it was likely to bomb spectacularly. But instead, what I found from the book’s very first paragraph was a voice that explodes off the page with both confidence and world-weariness, with stoicism and self-knowledge, with everything the character is going to exhibit in the rest of this blockbuster of a novel.Dickens’ David famously opens with, “Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.” By contrast, Kingsolver’s Copperhead (whose real name is Damon Fields, but he has red hair, so…) opens with, “First, I got myself born. A decent crowd was on hand to watch and they’ve always given me that much: the worst of the job was up to me, my mother being let’s just say out of it.”In this life, you make your own choices, and if you’re going to get anywhere, and your mother is in and out of rehab constantly, you have to do it yourself, Damon tells you at the beginning. You think there’s going to be a hero in your life? Think again. There’s just you, trying to make your way in a world that’s stacked against you. Here’s a voice that, in its tone of genuine down-home rural Americanism sounds a lot more like Huck Finn than anybody in Dickens. Like Huck, he has a memorable way of putting things in his colorful American vernacular: He’s “the Eagle Scout of trailer trash,” he tells us at one point.And I don’t mean to say that you must be familiar with David Copperfield to enjoy Demon Copperhead. You can follow the plot, empathize with the characters and absorb the themes of Kingsolver’s book without ever having heard of Dickens. But it does add something to the overall experience of the book if you know the Copperfield story. In particular, there’s a bit of fun for readers when they can recognize by name a Kingsolvian character intended to parallel a Dickensian one. Thus, when Damon’s abusive stepfather bears the name of “Stoner,” it’s easy to see the connection with David’s equally cruel stepfather, whose name happens to be “Murdstone.” Damon’s kind neighbors, the Peggots, clearly recall David’s friends the Peggottys and Clara Peggoty, David’s early nurse and lifelong friend. Dickens’ charming and narcissistic James Steerforth, who for a while promises to be that “hero of my own life” David looks forward to in his opening sentence, finds his counterpoint in Kingsolver’s Sterling Ford, nicknamed Fast Forward, star quarterback on the high school football team and, for awhile, Damon’s idol. Copperfield’s “child wife” Dora Spenlowe is echoed in Kingsolver’s Dori, and when Damon falls for his needy, childish Dori you don’t have to remember David Copperfield to know that relationship is going to be a disaster, but it helps.Occasionally Kingsolver’s parallel characters are direct mirror images of Dickens’, as in the case of Damon’s grandmother Betsy and her eccentric friend Mr. Dick, who liked flying kites, mirroring David’s great-aunt Betsy and her eccentric friend Mr. Dick who also liked flying kites. Sometimes there’s more of a difference: Damon’s short-term foster father Mr. McCobb has a few things in common with David’s Mr. Micawber, lack of steady employment and perpetual new schemes to get rich among them, but Micawber is a well-meaning screwup, while McCobb is just trying to take advantage of the system. And Dickens’ Uriah Heep is a far more insidious villain than Kingsolver’s assistant coach U-Haul Pyles, whose downfall is far less precipitous than Heep’s in Dickens. And then there is “Angus” Winfield, daughter of the high school football coach and Damon’s foster-sister during the best and worst years of his life, who clearly parallels David’s guardian angel, Agnes Wickfield, and who you know from the first is going to be a major influence in Damon’s life.Of course, knowing Dickens gives you an idea of the role these characters are going to play in the story. But the plot of Demon Copperhead is not therefore predictable, as Kingsolver translates these characters’ motivations and effects on the protagonist into a completely different milieu of time and place. Ultimately, what’s important about the influence of Dickens on Kingsolver’s book is not the superficial correspondences of plot or character, but rather their very significant agreement in terms of theme and authorial intent. In an afterword to her novel, Kingsolver writes, “I’m grateful to Charles Dickens for writing David Copperfield, his impassioned critique of institutional poverty and its damaging effects on children in his society. Those problems are still with us. In adapting his novel to my own place and time, working for years with his outrage, inventiveness, and empathy at my elbow, I’ve come to think of him as my genius friend.”It is precisely those social evils that Kingsolver has directly in her sites in this novel: The institutional poverty of former coal-mining areas of her native Appalachia; the effects of that poverty on children, especially children whose parents have been victims of that poverty and are dead or imprisoned. She attacks the ineptitude and bureaucracy of child welfare services, the abuse of the system of foster care that allows people like Damon’s foster parents to take children solely for the sake of taking the monthly support money, or for gaining slave labor like the tobacco farmer who first fosters Damon. She attacks a justice system that will accept the testimony of an abusive stepfather rather than the word of the abused child.But more than anything else she attacks the opioid crisis. Damon, who has a brief period when it seems he may escape the cesspool of his luckless life through success on the gridiron as a high school football star, has a terrible knee injury for which he is prescribed opioid pain relievers to which he becomes hopelessly addicted, and Kingsolver’s indictment of the doctors, salesmen, druggists, and especially the Sackler-owned Purdue Pharma are is merciless in the novel. It truly seems like there is no way out for Damon—but as David Copperfield had a talent in writing that finally helped pull him out of poverty, the fact that Damon has a talent for drawing—all he has left after football—does give him a ray of hope. I won’t spoil the end by telling you whether he’s able to use it.Thus Kingsolver is not simply the heir of Dickens in recasting his most personal novel; she is more importantly the spiritual heir of Dickens’ novel of social criticism, something you don’t see much of any more. Where is Dickens today? Where are the Zolas? The Sinclair Lewises? The John Steinbecks? Gone. But we’ve still got Barbara Kingsolver.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['Remarkably Bright Creatures, a captivating and heartfelt tale of loss, hope, friendship and new beginnings, follows a snarky octopus, a stoic elderly widow, a 30 year old man-child with abandonment issues, and a lonely music-loving grocer whose lives perfectly intertwine to solve a 30 year old mystery.Cameron is on a mission to finally find his father, while Tova is on a mission to unburden her friends of her presence. Thankfully, Marcellus the octopus is there to help them both. After a random series of events has Cameron taking over Tova’s job at the local aquarium, ever observant Marcellus pieces together what his favorite humans are too myopic to see.Van Pelt’s stunning writing captures you with its relatability and readability. These characters are funny and lovable while being simultaneously maddening. The friendships they develop are heartwarming and realistic, with genuine moments of complete, gut-wrenching honesty.In the author’s own words, this is a book “about getting unstuck.” As a reader you can’t help but root for these characters to realize the endless possibilities life has to offer them so they can get unstuck from the disappointing lives they are living. You’ll fall in love with the remarkably bright and mischievous Marcellus McSquiddles and his misguided human friends in this fabulous debut novel.',\n",
       "   'This was our February read for our local book club. It was a general consensus that everyone loved it even though it took awhile to get into the octopus angle! This is a unique debut that everyone should experience!1. An Octopus - I don’t know how many times I would think - huh, this is an octopus that is one of the main characters….huh - such a random idea that has become a popular story. But now I really want to learn more about these intelligent creatures 🐙2. Grief - Tova has had to deal with so much grief in her life. I love that she keeps plugging along and how honest she is.3. Friends - Tova has a great group of friends that truly want the best for her. They allow her the space to do what she needs to do and encourage her to see things a different way.4. A Long Buried Mystery - The whole of this story really revolves around a mystery that many people feel is solved but the most important people do not agree.5. Happiness - The book left me with mixed emotions - mostly happy ones but still some sadness. Although the parts that left me with sadness actually ended up just as they should have, so maybe those give me a sense of solace instead.',\n",
       "   \"My God, what a book. I was skeptical about the premise but you ain’t never met an octopus like this before. The last few chapters of the book left me in a puddle of tears fit to fill an aquarium! How do I love this book? Let me count the ways. The story the author comes up with is amazing. She starts with all these seemingly disparate pieces that come together beautifully like a jigsaw puzzle by the end of the book. The characters are beautifully broken, yet you never lose hope on them entirely, and the way they lift each other up lifts you up. There is profound grief and sadness, but also somehow a happy, hopeful but not over-the-top unbelievable ending. And the way the author brings animals to life, shows how they are so much better than we merely mortal humans… just wow. I cannot say enough good things about this book. I am telling all my reader friends with all the alacrity of a Ponzi scheme to drop everything and read this book. And from a first-time author, no less! Seriously, buy the damned book. And rush-order a box of tissues while you’re at it! You shan't regret it.\",\n",
       "   'The book starts a bit slowly (as so many do), but Tova and Marcellus captured my interest quickly.  I really liked the weaving of the ordinariness of Tova and the magic of Marcellus.  Both locked in their respective sad lives, their friendship such a relief.  Cameron is initially far too irritating, but as he finally starts growing up, I was happy to enjoy him, too.  These three characters, none of whom are good at emotional sharing, manage to bring love and joy into their worlds.',\n",
       "   'Enjoyed this tale. I felt a immediate liking to the character Tova who I could relate to personally. Tova reminded me of my Aunt Tove from Denmark. Same kind of personality and loving kindness. The dynamics between Marcellus and Tova was quite heartwarming and funny.The author does a wonderful job of weaving this story of twists and turns into a heart warming tale. I truly enjoyed this read. Thank you.',\n",
       "   'Ms. Van Pelt’s first novel tells a wonderful story about the intersection of the lives of a seventy-year-old woman (Tova) on the brink of going into a nursing home, a young man (Cameron) in search of his family, and a remarkable octopus living out his days in a small-town aquarium. There is so much to like about this story…high on the list is the interpersonal relationships in the small-town setting…and then there’s Marcellus the octopus. I may have balked at this octopus’ character had I not once watched a documentary about a special bond between a troubled human and a curious mollusk. The relationship ship between Marcellus and Tova was such a special thread of the story. I also have a thing about stories that have the title hidden somewhere in the chapters…a fun find. I look forward to more from this author.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"Some personal background first. In 2010 my cousin, who was 21, was involved in a car accident. I don't remember all the intricate details, but he got into a verbal altercation with another person in a parking lot that moved to the road. The two drivers (one being my cousin) we're racing where the other vehicle was driving in the oncoming lane and ended up clipping my cousin's vehicle. The other vehicle wrecked and three occupants died. My cousin left the scene, drove back by, didn't stop and also didn't call 911. He was sentenced to 99 years for three counts of murder and 10 years for leaving the scene of an accident with injuries to be served consecutively after his 99 year sentence. The judge assumed that he had no remorse due to his stoic appearance in court. He is still serving his first sentence in a state prison. He had a three year old daughter and a wife when he was sentenced. He is now divorced, and his ex-wife and daughter have moved to Virginia. I don't know when the last time he's seen his daughter. I have only met her once.I started reading Colleen Hoover in 2012 when Slammed was available for review on NetGalley. I loved it. And she became an auto-buy author for me. After 20+ books, I feel like I know her writing style to the point where she surprises me less and less even with her books such as Verity and Layla. As a matter of fact, her most recently published books have been my least favorite she's written... until Reminders of Him. This book reminded me of old Colleen Hoover.Kenna was involved in a car accident with her boyfriend. She was driving. She was under the influence. She thought he was dead. She couldn't find a cell phone, and so she left the scene of the accident. I won't get into more than that with the details because that's part of the story. But she was barely pregnant and subsequently gave birth while incarcerated. Her daughter was taken from her care and placed in the custody of her boyfriend's parents. She has now, 4 years later, been released and hopes to reestablish her connection with her daughter.Ledger was Scottie, Kenna's boyfriend's, best friend. He wasn't around much when Kenna and Scottie started dating so he'd never met the girl who murdered his best friend. Ledger has spent the last 5 years creating a version of Kenna in his head. Only when he finally meets her in person, not knowing who she is, he slowly comes to find out that she isn't anything he imagined her to be.The pain in this book was palpable. Every single character is deeply filled with pain. Kenna lost the love of her life and her daughter in and because of one terrible moment and decision. Scottie's parents are so filled with grief that they can't see past their own pain to anyone else's. Ledger is hurting too. He misses his friend, he loves Scottie's parents like his own, he wants to protect Diem (Scottie and Kenna's daughter), and he's falling for the one person he never could have imagined.Favorite quotes:-She's quiet, but she's said just enough to make me want the rest of her words.-It's incredible how two people who have never met can have so many of the same mannerisms.-It proves that time, distance, and devastation allow people enough opportunity to craft villains out of people they don't even know.I only had two complaints that I can remember right now. Roman is a side character who happens to have a crush on a married woman. He isn't actively pursuing her. Like he's not asking her out or anything. But he does regularly show up at her bakery to buy cupcakes from her. He's wishing for her marriage to fail. I think this sucks. Obviously these people exist. Not all people, married and unmarried, respect the commitment two people make to each other. But sheesh, I think enough marriages fail on their own without outsiders wishing, hoping, and waiting for their opportunity to swoop in and snatch one party up. I just wish this wasn't included even though it was such a small part of the overall story.My second complaint is, yet again, Colleen Hoover uses letters as a major plot component. At first I wondered if she was doing this out of like a writing shortcut. You know how a villain will spell out all of their evil plans to the hero of a movie in one big speech. Well, in several of her books I've felt like she uses letters as big information drops. And she does that again in Reminders of Him. I can't say CoHo is reading my reviews of her books, but I honestly felt like she was almost using the letters in Reminders of Him to spite me. That's very conceited of me, I realize. So what I think is the more likely option is that she's doing it on purpose. Maybe this is becoming a calling card of hers or something. Like she's seeking out opportunities to include letters in her books rather than using them as a crutch to dump information. I would still like to see her write a book that doesn't include a letter like these, but we'll see.Reminders of Him was my favorite Colleen Hoover release in the last several years. This blows Verity and Layla and especially Regretting You out of the water. I used to feel a little apathetic towards her books due to repetition and the big reveal being more important than the journey, but Reminders of Him renewed my Colleen Hoover enthusiasm. The similarities and differences to my own cousin's life and accident made this all the more relatable to me. Reminders of Him gets 5 Stars. Have you read Reminders of Him? What did you think? Let me know!\",\n",
       "   \"This book can have all the stars and more. Colleen Hoover never disappoints me and this book genuinely moved me. Coho can rip your heart out but it always seems to be worth it in the end. I've been putting off reading this book for a while now because I knew it would make me emotional and I knew that it would make me feel things that I typically avoid.This book follows a 26 year old woman named Kenna who just spent the last 5 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter. When she's released, she makes her way back to where the person she loved once lived and tries to fight for her life and future back. Things get complicated when she falls for a man named Ledger who is connected to her past and what she's fighting to get back.I was rooting for Kenna but I was also so frustrated at the same time. I judged her harshly and quickly just as everyone else in her life did. I'm glad my opinion of her changed and then when it did, all I wanted was the absolute world for her. I wanted her happy ending and I wanted to know that she would be okay. This book is all about love, loss, grief, acceptance and how everyone deals with everything in different ways. These are emotions that are hard to deal with but Colleen Hoover makes it happen. I am in love with this book and I am in love with Kenna and Ledger and their story.\",\n",
       "   \"I actually read this book for the kindle challenge, it was the only book that looked better than the others.... I wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did.... Excellent author, this book was so well written, I could feel the emotions in this book.... There were parts in this book that broke my heart.... Watching Kenny go threw the struggle, replay the car accident even with her boyfriend Scotty, not fighting her case because she felt like she needed to be punish because she felt guilty, then find out she was pregnant while she was in jail.... TlScotty parents found out and went for custody of the baby, and take all her rights away, since she was sentence to five years the judge granted scotty's parents full custody of the baby who is Diem.... Kenny writes to Scotty since he passed away.... Ledger meets Kenny at a bar no knowing that she was the one that killed his bestfriend, they hit it off at first but soon after he found who she is.... Kenny made herself broke moving to the same town as her daughter, that is where she also meets the owner of the bar Ledger who used to be Scotty bestfriend.... They end up having a connection before either know who each other are.... Everyone in town wants her gone.... Scotty parents haven't forgive her.... Things get complicated, she has no money to move again so she ends up working at the bar to ger extra money that's when her and Ledger get closer.... He sees a different side of her and realize she would be good for Diem, the only thing is trying to convince Scotty's parents who still hate her and want nothing to do with her.....\"]},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['Mad Honey is a bit of a challenge to write about, mostly because I don\\'t want to ruin any of this excellent read for others out there. At its foundation, it\\'s the love story of two high school seniors: Asher -- captain of the hockey team, the popular kid in school -- and Lily -- newly transferred in to their high school in New Hampshire from California. The story alternates chapters between those told from Lily\\'s point of view, and those told from the point of view of Asher\\'s mother, Olivia. And, in an interesting twist, Lily\\'s chapters are told in reverse chronological order.That reverse chronology choice allows us to see a unique perspective of the moments that built Asher\\'s and Lily\\'s relationship. When we meet them, they are deeply in love. And working backwards from there, we get to see the building blocks laid down for that relationship. We also get to see when key pieces of information were disclosed and how that changed things for both of them.The novel is not purely about the two lovebirds, although they are clearly at the center. Olivia, as the narrator of half of the chapters, is in many ways more of the focus than Asher, and the reader gets to see how she relates to her son as well as how she copes with the challenges of her abusive relationship with her ex-husband (and Asher\\'s father), Braden. Her brother plays a prominent role in the story as well, and I think that the authors did a really fine job of capturing sibling love (and tension), as well as the guilt her brother feels for not recognizing the abuse in Olivia\\'s marriage.Against that setting, there is tragedy that happens relatively early in the novel, and a murder trial that dominates a good portion of the book. Those who read Defending Jacob by William Landay (an excellent read, by the way, if you have never sought it out) will likely pick up on some parallels and common themes. But, where that was a more straightforward legal thriller, this is a wholly unique novel that carries the story to significantly greater depths, with a surprising twist about halfway through that plays a brilliant role in the novel executing its purpose.I had never read anything by Jennifer Finney Boylan, and the only book I had previously read from Jodi Picoult was My Sister\\'s Keeper, and that was over a decade ago. Despite a lot of press and buzz,  thought My Sister\\'s Keeper was...fine, but mostly unremarkable. Mad Honey is significantly better. As the authors share in the acknowledgments, Picoult actually wrote all of the Olivia chapters, and Finney Boylan wrote all of those from Lily\\'s point of view. Except, just to keep things interesting and to make sure it felt consistent throughout, they each wrote one of the opposite chapters. I had no idea that was the case while reading, and I think even if I re-read the novel with that knowledge, I\\'d have a very hard time picking which chapters were written by the \"other\" author. That\\'s a long way of saying that despite having two authors, the novel feels seamless and as if it was written by one person.If you read Mad Honey purely for plot, it\\'s a compelling mystery / legal thriller. But because of the subject matter and the layers built into that solid plot, it\\'s quite a bit more. That depth elevates it from something good to something more powerful and important than it perhaps would have been otherwise. This will keep you entertained, and you\\'ll learn something along the way as well. Highly recommended.',\n",
       "   'This book has received so many reviews that to recap, the story would just be superfluous. Let me begin by saying this intense read, should be experienced by wide variety of people. The main point of the book is love. A mother’s love and young love. Transgender ism, and how it affects the individual, parents, and those with whom they interact. It’s a great teaching tool, and I learned fascinating facts regarding transgendering.  The apiary explanations  were fascinating.and educational as well as showing the relationships, and how they affect the hive community.No Mad Honey is a definite must read. The authors remarks from at the end of the book are informative.The legal portion which involved the preparation and quart room scenes were exceptional. We have an insight into the relationship between the client and his legal representation.Spoiler alerts: There a few things that I found unsettling.  It was disappointing that Maya was never prosecuted or outed for her involvement. And, there was no resolution as far as Braden, his new family and his abuse toward Olivia.',\n",
       "   '\"Mad Honey\" is a unique collaboration between two talented authors, Jennifer Finney Boylan and Jodi Picoult. The book explores the history, science, and culture surrounding the use of mad honey, a substance with both medicinal and potentially dangerous effects.The writing in this book is excellent, with each author bringing their own unique style and perspective to the topic. The chapters are well-organized and flow seamlessly from one to the next, providing a comprehensive overview of mad honey and its various uses throughout history.One of the things I appreciated most about this book was its accessibility. Despite the complex subject matter, the authors do an excellent job of explaining scientific concepts and historical events in a way that is easy to understand and engaging to read.Overall, \"Mad Honey\" is a fascinating and thought-provoking read that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in exploring the complexities of this unique substance. Four stars',\n",
       "   \"This book is like being on a swing. It goes up and down. I enjoyed reading Lily's story and I liked Asher from the beginning and their live story. I didn't realize this was a transgender story in the beginning and had to go back and take a second look. I always felt like Asher wasn't the killer and was guessing who could have killed Lily. I didn't guess correctly but I was saddened by the fact that we don't learn much once the person responsible is named. That was a let down. I wanted them to pay. I liked learning about the bees but it was so much information and I wanted more of the rest of the story. I wanted to know if Lily's dad ever contacted Ava. I wanted more money f Jordan and his wife because I loved them just from the descriptions from Olivia's story. I learned so much in this book about transgender. I learned terms that I don't typically hear and I felt compassion for Lily and Ava. I wanted Lily to live and experience an amazing love with Asher. Finally, I think Mike was amazing and I'm happy for Olivia. It would be nice to read a sequel and find out what's happened to these characters 5-10 years from now.

       "  'reviews': ['Where do I start? As a mom, it was difficult to read how the actions of another mom could be so emotionally damaging to her child in the pursuit of her own selfish ambitions. But what is a child to do at such a young age, when they rely on the ‘good intentions’ of the parent to always be both their protector and cheerleader? Children are so vulnerable and ever pleasing, so it’s not a surprise to see how Jeanette tried to juggle both – with the ever-pleasing part of her personality so heartbreakingly dominate. She tells her story with honesty, wit, pain, and self-discovery – with the later coming at her own expense through the journey of her traumatic childhood. It is no wonder that she suffered from so many of the self-destructive, and mom-induced actions of her youth, which not surprisingly, then followed her into adulthood – which was tragic in itself, affecting this transition. I both loved her story, but hated what I was reading at the same time! I had to keep reading, though, because I needed to see how Jeanette would come out of this trauma, but I was only slightly fulfilled at the end, wanting her to emerge unscathed. But just like any person who has experienced trauma in their life – time cannot completely erase it all. Still, as a mom, I feel like I want to give Jeanette a Motherly hug and tell her everything will be okay one day, because just like my own child – I want her to feel whole and deeply loved!',\n",
       "   'I’m significantly older than the iCarly crowd; my children, too young. As it wasn’t a staple in our household, I’d only seen a few episodes. I do remember really liking Miranda Kerr, perfectly cast as the smart ,ambitious girl, was very likable, even from an adult standpoint. But my favorite was Jennette McCurdy. Sam spoke, not only to the rebel in us all, but to the bigger picture. She was completely unaffected, unapologetic and downright comfortable in her skin.How McCurdy pulls this off, amidst being sexually and emotionally abused by a mother, who put her in the position of family breadwinner (at age eight) is incomprehensible. Tragic irony is all we can see, as she’s capitulated to stardom in the role of the comedian.Apparently, it wasn’t enough for McCurdy’s mother to sexually and emotionally traumatize her: in the purest form of dysfunction, McCurdy’s mother teaches her the fine points of anorexia. And under the guise of being a supportive mother, she tells McCurdy (as she’s entering puberty) that she must look as young as possible. Only severe calorie restriction would stop her from growing quickly, and expand her chances at being cast. She even sets a goal weight for her (now-teenaged) daughter:89 lbs.But the real genius of this book is that McCurdy speaks in the voice of the child she was and, painfully, still seems to be. How could she not? Her life stopped at the age of eight, when she realized the one person she should have been able to trust the most, was the person trying to destroy her. McCurdy gives us all the details and leaves them there for us to either accept or reject. Her credibility never waivers and she lays everything bare as it pertains to herself.It’s a graphic novel. It’s hard to read, at times. I recognized myself as the daughter who only wanted her mother to be happy and proud of her. The daughter that just wanted to be enough.But the flipside was that I found it impossible to read this book and suspend any self-examination of myself as a mother. I’ve used tears to guilt-trip and manipulate my kids, justifying my behavior by wallowing in the (preferred) state of denial and excuses. It was OK, because it was for their own good. But McCurdy reminds us that the power wielded  by mothers is immeasurable, and that the same love and devotion we use to nurture our children and keep them safe can also be used to destroy them. It’s sort of like an avalanche; we kick a small rock at the top, forgetting what it gathers up on the way down, and how it ends.Being a mother can be the best or worst job in the world, sometimes changing hourly. McCurdy is right when she observes that any and all mothers are automatically perceived, as Saints (I always figured it was because women need some motivation to procreate-instant deification seems a good start). However, McCurdy rails against this societal dogma, and she’s right to do so. We don’t deserve anything for making the choice to become a mother. If anything, we set ourselves up for the hardest job imaginable, yet are guilty of treating it, as an afterthought .No one can really tell us how to do it and the benefits are never certain. But we signed up for it. We are reminded of our obligation to our children, as we see things fall apart for McCurdy, and we realize that her story is a cautionary tale in every way.',\n",
       "   'I devoured this book in a day plus one morning. Her writing is so clear and compelling and I appreciated how she let a moment hang for the reader to digest as opposed to explaining or analyzing it. I only know her from Sam and Cat because my daughter was into that show for a short while, so it’s amazing the amount of resilience a person can exhibit, pretending and acting and showing up, while inside they’re boiling over with pain.Her mother was a piece of work, to say the least, (so was her grandmother while we’re at it) And after reading this book, and then seeing a bunch articles in newspapers recently talking about how “our teenage girls are not OK“ and how society is doing this damage and society is laying on this pressure…I can’t help but wonder: What about the parents? Maybe I’ve seen too many Netflix documentaries and listened to too many podcasts, but it seems like each and every single person interviewed relays some sort of abuse they’ve suffered in their childhood. Are there any parents who just try to love and nurture their kids as best they can and not psychologically damage them? That would be worth looking into because I think stories like Jennette’s aren’t that uncommon, they’re just happening away from the spotlight.',\n",
       "   \"I had never heard of Jennette McCurdy before this book. Her previous acting gigs went over my head. But wow, this one doesn't pull any punches. I love reading and often read more than one book a day (when I have a day off from work). I spent all day on this book because I had to keep stopping to reflect and collect my thoughts. It was heavy but also hopeful. It was interesting but also heartbreaking. It was addictive in how it was written, McCurdy doing an excellent job making every situation clear and like you were there with her. I'm glad she got help, that she is healing, and I think this book will be so encouraging for others to do that, too. Definitely recommend!\"]},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['While there is a horse featured predominantly in this book, it is about so much more—about kindness, fairness, discipline, and love, cruelty, bigotry, abuse, and sadness.  All of these elements are woven into the historical fiction account of a racehorse, the people in his life, both real and imagined, and the bigotry and love through generations.  For me, reading anything by Geraldine Brooks is akin to listening to a Puccini aria.  Her prose fairly sings with the grace and beauty of words that lift the story and the people to heights unimagined.  While I have enjoyed all of her books that I have read, this one has raced to the finish line in first place, with its characters, both human and animal, that transcend the ordinary.  Give it a read—you will laugh, cry, be angry, sad, and ever so glad that you invested the time and energy in such a wonderful book.',\n",
       "   'This is a beautifully written piece of historical fiction. Brook\\'s depiction of the intense bond between Jarrett (the enslaved trainer) and Lexington (the Horse) is absolutely magical. This book is thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking. If you are too narrow-minded to consider characters whose experiences are very different from your own, if you cannot muster up enough empathy to \"walk in someone else\\'s shoes\", then perhaps this book is not for you.',\n",
       "   \"I admit I wrestled with this book at first. As a historical novelist, I was surprised I found the modern part more interesting than the historical...in the beginning. Then the historical portion grabbed my attention. I wanted to stay in Jarrett's POV. His easy, sweet handling of Darley, later Lexington, carried the narrative. Lexington became his own character through Jarret's eyes. I'd never heard of the race horse Lexington, probably due to his short career.What happened to Theo was tragic, and a deeper dive into Jess wouldn't have hurt. A slow start to a to a fine novel.I don't understand all the reviewer complaints about Wokeness. Being Woke is to be aware of injustice and discrimination. We should all be aware so we can make things better.\",\n",
       "   \"This book was a showstopper.  Beautifully written with compelling, carefully drawn characters (including one amazing horse) and a plausible plot, it bounces back and forth between two non-consecutive centuries.  Rarely do books that do that appeal to me; they sometimes make me feel like a ping pong ball.  But it was the only way to tell this story.  To the author's credit, it is a historical novel with a healthy dose of accuracy due to her painstaking research.  Race and slavery intermingle with art to make it readable on many levels.  Once ensnared, I couldn't put it down.\",\n",
       "   'One doesn’t have to be a fan of horse racing to fully enjoy the story telling. The author, Geraldine Brooks, uses historical characters and places, and weaves a fictional narrative to connect many events that transport the reader to that time period. She cleverly uses a split story with characters in the 21st c that help support the truth of early horse racing beginnings that produced champions; And in doing so makes statements on social justice and discrimination highlighting the horrors of slavery and remnants that remain today through Jess, a white Aussie bone expert and Theo, a black graduate art historian raised as a son of a biracial marriage in British schools. The linkage in time unfolds through horse portraitures and the bones of a champion racer, Lexington.  This book is now one on my favorite read list.  Readers will also love the author’s writing that creates vivid imagery using elegant metaphors describing the study of bones and paces.',\n",
       "   'This is third novel I’ve read by this author & can’t wait to read more. She has outstanding story telling abilities & character development couldn’t be better. Loved this story of horse raising & racing in civil-war era. Horse racing is abhorrent to me as it is nothing short of animal cruelty & this book only enforced my view. this book also tells story of enslaved people & free Black’s as well. The horror of it all is still hard to comprehend. Only thing i didn’t care for is the telling of four people’s story at the same time. The switching back & forth between different narrators was distracting from the main story & in the end the relevance just didn’t seem worth the while. Frankly I don’t like when authors use such a platform to make social commentary. Save that for the appropriate forum but leave it out of a novel unless social Justice is the main focus of the book. For me it didn’t fit here. Still enjoyed the book & would highly recommend this authors work (esp March) just not the commentary.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['I am not usually drawn to books written by Stephen King but there was something that was very intriguing for me about Fairy Tale that made me want to read it. After I started to notice that so many of the people I am friends with on goodreads had given Fairy Tale such high praise, I decided to give it a try. I decided that if I determined that it was not for me I had at least given it a try. Within just a few minutes I was completely immersed into the plot of Fairy Tale. Stephen King created engaging and likable characters for the most part. I listened to the audiobook that was brilliantly narrated by Seth Numrich and Stephen King, himself. Since I had Fairy Tale downloaded on my kindle, I also read certain parts as well. It was fast paced, so creative and well plotted. I was glad that I decided to read/listen to this book since in my opinion it was a creative gem.Fairy Tale was told in the first person by twenty-four year old Charlie Reade as he looked back on his life the year he had turned seventeen. Charlie had been an only child. He lived in Sentry, Illinois with his mother and father. One afternoon when Charlie had been seven years old, his mother had decided to walk to town to buy a bucket of chicken for dinner. His mother left Charlie and his father watching a baseball game on the television. After buying the bucket of chicken, Charlie’s mother started to walk home. She was eating an extra piece of the chicken while she walked. As she started to cross “that G D bridge” on her way home, a truck came out of nowhere, hit her and she died instantly. Charlie and his father were devastated as they learned about her death. The only way that Charlie’s father was able to cope with his wife’s death was by drowning his sorrows with alcohol. Before too long, Charlie’s father was a certifiable alcoholic. Charlie was forced to grow up very fast. He became the caregiver for his father. When Charlie’s father’s drinking problems became so severe, he was fired from his job. Charlie envisioned that he and his father could potentially become homeless or worse. It was then that Charlie started to pray that his father would stop drinking. Charlie made a promise to G-d that day. If G-d would make his father stop drinking, Charlie would pay it forward and help someone else in need. Just in the nick of time, Charlie’s father’s friend stepped in. His father’s friend became his sponsor in Alcoholic’s Anonymous. Taking one baby step at a time, Charlie’s father found his way to sobriety.There was a house at the top of the hill on the street that Charlie lived that was known by the neighborhood children as the “psycho house “. One day, Charlie was walking home and as he was passing that house he heard a dog barking frantically. The man who lived there was quite reclusive. No one knew a lot about him and he seldom left his home. One of Charlie’s friends had warned him that he had seen the dog that lived there several years ago and that it was quite vicious. Charlie pondered about what to do. He thought that something was wrong. Charlie decided to climb over the fence to see. When Charlie got to the backyard, he saw that the old man that lived there had fallen off a ladder and was hurt very badly. Charlie called 911 and got an ambulance to come and help the man. The man’s name was Mr. Bowditch. It was just Mr. Bowditch and his dog, Radar that lived in the house. Mr Bowditch did not have a wife, children or any living relatives. Before the ambulance took Mr. Bowditch to the hospital, Charlie offered to take care of Radar and feed him for Mr. Bowditch. That was the beginning of Charlie making good on the promise he made with G-d. Over the course of Mr. Bowditch’s recovery, Charlie became his caregiver and the two formed the most unlikely but beautiful friendship that anyone could have imagined.Mr. Bowditch was not your typical neighbor as you might have already surmised. He hoarded lots of things in his house and he was opposed to modern day conveniences and technology. His t.v. was probably as old as he was. It had rabbit ears and an antenna on the roof. He was not in the possession of a cell phone or a computer and he had no desire to own one either. One thing was apparent, though. Mr. Bowditch loved Radar with all his heart and the same could be said for Radar’s feelings towards Mr. Bowditch. When Mr. Bowditch came home from the hospital, he began to confide in Charlie about some things. Mr. Bowditch had to pay the hospital for his stay and the surgeries he had. Charlie learned about the gold that Mr. Bowditch was in possession of and that strange noises that could be heard coming from the padlocked shed on Mr. Bowditch’s property. Mr. Bowditch revealed information to Charlie on a need to know basis. One day, while Charlie was at school, he got a call from Mr. Bowditch. Charlie could tell that something was wrong. Mr. Bowditch was having a heart attack. He needed Charlie to know some very important things. Probably the most important thing Mr. Bowditch revealed to Charlie had to do with the shed on his property. Mr. Bowditch told Charlie that within the shed was a well that led to the “other world” where the sundial existed. Years ago, Mr. Bowditch had gone on the sundial to make himself younger. Mr. Bowditch had shared this information with Charlie already. As Charlie continued listening to the all that Mr. Bowditch had to tell him, tears welled up in his eyes. Charlie knew that Mr. Bowditch was dying. By the time that the ambulance got to Mr. Bowditch’s house, he was already dead. Charlie took Radar to his own house. Radar became his dog on that day. Unfortunately, Radar was also quite old and didn’t have long to live. That was when a plan started to formulate in Charlie’s mind. He could not loose Radar too. Charlie would do whatever he had to do to find the sundial and make Radar young again.The next part of Fairy Tale took place in the “other world” known as Empis. The fairy tale characters were very creative yet believable. Charlie’s adventurous journey was full of discovery, magic, dangers, good, evil and monsters. Some of the scenes were gruesome and unpleasant but for the most part they were well plotted and even uplifting. The ending was quite satisfying and it tied everything up quite nicely. I found myself thinking about the characters long after the book ended. Charlie was my favorite character by far. I am so glad that I took a chance and read Fairy Tale by Stephen King. I highly recommend it.',\n",
       "   'The dog lives. She is the best girl and she lives, so don\\'t worry.This is a slow start. A slow enough start that I was like \"Ugh.\" But the slow was interesting enough, because so much of it revolved around Radar, who is the best girl, and the people who love her, that I didn\\'t mind the slow. And then there was a point, about halfway, where I stopped to consider the beginning and how slow it was and how much lead up and space it took and I had to concede that most of it was necessary. Was all of it? Maybe not. But the parts that weren\\'t, I think I\\'ve ignored.Also, as a fun time, this book isn\\'t set in Maine. It\\'s set somewhere in Illinois near Chicago. Which was a pleasant surprise. And also, Cujo got a shoutout. Which made my head hurt in the logistics of the meta.This is as classic a case of The Hero\\'s Journey as I think has come out since Star Wars. I mean, it\\'s pretty beat for beat. I mean, you have a literally descent into a literal underworld (twice), a call to action (twice), a refusal to the call, an old mentor, a supernatural being giving aid, return to the overworld where nothing can ever be the same for the hero, the whole shebang. Those elements that are basically required reading for a Hero\\'s Journey, you\\'ve got. So if you\\'re looking for a book to study that type of plot, here you go. Look no further. Also, the interesting part is that there\\'s a Hero\\'s Journey within the Hero\\'s Journey.Once the descent into the underworld occurred, I was fully on board. Tension stayed high because Radar. Again, she lives. Which I knew because this is Stephen King and I was not going to read a book about a dog from him if the dog didn\\'t live so I 100% looked up from other reviews if the dog lived and she does so I was happy to read it. Knowing that didn\\'t change the amount of gut wrenching panic I was feeling for her. And then at about halfway through, there were too many pages left for the amount of story. And then everything went to crap again, as I expected, and the tension this time was on Charlie. Which is good. And Radar lives.The tension was high all the way through. There were some teeny bits that probably could have been cut out, but I like the page count. It made it really easy for me to know exactly how much of the book I had left at any given point.',\n",
       "   'So I read a 600 page book and for the first 575 pages I\\'m like:  I wonder when it kicks in; very descriptive but this is a slow burn; I like this Charlie character (I think), well, kinda, but why the title?!?, this isn\\'t a fairy tale; I wonder when it kicks in; this is the worst Stephen King story ever; ... BUT when I finished I was like:: Shazam!! OMG!! I gotta read that again!!!!Its definitely unlike any Stephen King story I\\'ve encountered; different than any fairy tale ever told; and is absolutely and uniquely brilliant!! I don\\'t even know what to say about the plot development, the characters, the setting, or anything else about it without revealing more than a review should say!!  But if you love a great story about a boy and his dying dog ---except its not that; its not really his dog, at least at first, but ... well, and it doesn\\'t die ... ( can\\'t say why without revealing ....) ... oh, my, ...So imagine a combination of \"Alice\\'s Adventure in Wonderland\" with \"The Princess Bride\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" ... kinda, but different!!Oh, and filled with amazing Easter Eggs of sorts with quotes and characters that don\\'t fit but pop in at the most amazing times!!So, at the end of this review I hope I\\'ve told you nothing except you really, really, really ought to read this book!!!  (Just, get comfy, and buckle in!)']},\n",

With his kind and gentle words, the author clearly explains how our reactions are a reflection of our conditioning and imprinting and how we can reclaim our power and let go of the past narrative by choosing to react to similar distressing situations in a different way and commit to healing.He also clearly addressed attachment as our mind holding on to familiar old labels (even when they don’t serve us well) and resistance to change. Change is scary and we humans fear uncertainty, but Pueblo provided a refreshing new perspective to change - change isn’t necessarily bad or unsettling - just like how life would not be possible without change, one would be less likely to heal and embrace one’s full potential if it were not to change.I was also really impressed by the last few chapters where he attributed the rise and falls of kingdoms and the repeated tragedies of history as a byproduct of unhealed communities and ego’s desire to create hierarchies as opposed to the common belief that humanity is ultimately dark, selfish and evil. His words are at once gentle, inspiring and hopeful and provides hope to the current challenges (e.g. climate change) and healing of the entire human race.',\n",

But I was sure she had a back story. I knew she encountered racism throughout her career and I wanted to know her story.She revealed so many different aspects of her life that any woman can connect with. I particularly like the 1st date with her husband. Her being happy and finding love 💕 warmed my heartShe makes me so proud. Everything she had to endure and still come out on top and still being humble. She’s and just an awesome person. I watched her Oprah interview but reading her memoir gave so much more depth to her struggles.',\n",
       "   \"Finished 'Finding Me' by Viola Davis, and wow what a read! For reference, this has been my 18th read of 2023 and blew every. single. other books out of the water! (Other biographies/memoirs i have read this year include McCurdy's and Michelle Obamas, which are also amazing reads but...still. this one..wow). It shares her struggles of growing up impoverished as a dark-skinned little girl, a story filled with SA, Violence, Racism. Heart-breaking but her resiliency and communications leaves no room for pity but that of pure admiration and empathy. Her journey into finding her calling, and chasing it even as a child in adversity, attending Juilliard and breaking glass ceilings, and trials and tribulations of trying to be seen as the talented, beautiful woman she is, in an  industry that found her to be too 'ugly' 'undesirable' and  (in her literal words) only fitting for 'drug-addicted black mother' roles. Viola simultaneously shares her candid emotional journey and of unlearning hate of her dark-skin, discovering what healthy self-love and being a recipient of worthiness looks like, and the emotional conflicts faced of those who break generational curses and carry the burden of supporting their family financially ...in her case  19+ (parents, siblings, nieces and nephews) along the way.\",\n",
       "   'I listened to the memoir up until it finished. There were times while I was driving I went through so many emotions while listening from screaming No, crying, amazed, afraid, and lots of times shocked as to how anyone can endure such grave hardships as a child like Viola shared. What I really loved the most was how she prayed for the man she desired, and the Lord blessed her with exactly what she prayed for. I loved hearing how much he protected and loved her and such genuine care for her after failed relationships in the past. Every person should either listen or read Finding Me.',\n",
       "   'Amazing! Inspiring! Her strength in her writing comes from her back ground,  Her childhood, family life, poverty , Terrible home life, Yet she had love. She loved her family and her family loved her There was love that existed despite the extreme poverty. That is how she survived, evolved with sheer determination and self healed a work in progress throughout her life,  and found her happiness as a human being against all odds.She is a great actress whom I admired but more than that , she is a great human being who won in the game of life where she was dealt with terrible cards.My hats off to Viola , the Human to Viola  who is a good daughter, good sister, good wife and a mother on top of being an Oscar winning actress! She is the winner all the way. Kudos to you Viola! I admire you for every thing you are.',\n",
       "   \"There is nothing more powerful than witnessing testimony of a powerful person's vulnerability. An honestly narrated story of G my okod's power and self realization. This book is for any person who feels weighted down by ghosts of the past. Ms Davis starts the story with force that jilts the unsuspecting reader. Then as one ends the journey, we see a concluding thought that takes us back to the beginning and the triumph that is the beautiful Viola Davis.\",\n",
       "   \"I haven't been able to read a book to completion in a very long time.  Only something compelling, gripping, relevant and real would hold me...keep me...and have me turn each page wondering...what will she say next?  Now what is going to happen?As talented an actor as Viola Davis is...and I am a huge fan...she has taken her place as an author standing next to the likes of Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou...and it is my fervent hope that she will write and publish again...and again.  Whether it be non fiction or not...I am now able to list her as one of my favorite writers of all time.  This book has become a turning point for me.Thank you, Ms. Davis, for sharing your story and doing it so beautifully.  And I'll share that I haven't even finished it yet.  That's how important it is that I write this now, before I am too emotional to do so.\",\n",
       "   'This was a book club selection, and while I’m not a fan of Memoirs because they are boring…this one held a spark for me. It kept me reading, even when it felt soooooo sloooowwww. I can’t put my finger on why, because at the end of the day while it describes Davis’s upbringing; her challenges as a black woman, and the life she left in order to find herself in the life she’s in, it also showed depth to society as a whole and a perspective most POC cannot articulate to the average white person without there being a sense of bitterness or resentment for the history suffered.This book was well-written, sensitive and strong, it took emotion and anger but not in a way to tear another down, instead simply showing a perspective we may not see, nor understand. I would recommend anyone read this who loves Davis as an actress, but more so to get to know Viola as a person. Because she is a beautiful one, inside and out.',\n",
       "   'A great read about Viola Davis’ Life and healing journey with herself as she goes back to the origin of her 8 year old self. Beautifully written and inspiring to see what she had to do to survive such challenges. I learned a lot from her book.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"The only other TJR novel I’ve read was one that thoroughly stunned me—DAISY JONES AND THE SIX. Reid captured the time period, the rock scene, and the characters with so much heart and authenticity that I was open and ready to read another of her works. But tennis? It wasn’t until I scanned some reviews that specifically stated that you don’t need to understand tennis to enjoy this book that I decided to go for it. And they were right! CARRIE SOTO is a smashing character in a champion story.In CARRIE SOTO, tennis is primary, but also the volley for TJR’s themes about the human condition. And Carrie Soto is so vivid, intense, and fully dimensional—known in the tennis world as the Battle Axe-- that she lived in my home and in my heart on every page. In fact, I even dreamt about her, she was that pressed into my literary soul. Carrie is single-minded, merciless when it comes to the court. Her unyielding nature, however, has its pitfalls; her personal life is the love you only get in tennis.It's 1994, and Carrie is 37, retired for six years. Still single, she trusts nobody enough to get close to but her agent, Gwen, and her father, Javier, who raised her himself (her mother died when she was very young). In his home country of Argentina, Javier made quite a splash in tennis until he was injured. He turned to coaching his daughter. He started teaching her the game when she turned two.Carrie is tightly coiled and at arm’s length from the rest of the human race. Her solitary life leaves little room for laughter. Soto was a ten-time Wimbledon champ and winner of more Slams than any other woman in history—until the new It-girl Nicki Chan surpasses Carrie’s Slam record in ‘94. Carrie decides to go back into the game to defend her record and show that she’s still the world’s best tennis player.The novel gradually fills in the background time gaps so that the reader pieces together what makes Carrie tick. A tennis phenom, she was also a walking time bomb—I kept waiting for the inevitable explosion. I did learn intriguing tennis facts that I ate up despite my indifference to the sport itself. Reid has an exciting way of revealing the game without boring the reader. And the sport is also a metaphor for Carrie’s drive, her spirit, her priorities, and her sense of self and self-esteem. As the competitive drive consumes Carrie, it absorbed me, too.  Her obsessive nature was in her DNA.“I’m back at war, after years of not knowing how to live during peacetime. This is the only place where I make sense to myself.”Tennis was all that Carrie lived for. Reid created a stark character that the reader, by turns, dares to understand and occasionally wants to tromp. Soto’s fanaticism is also what defines her, and binds her and inevitably can blind her. She guards her emotions and steers her life away from others. Training and competing means meeting the world at large—but on whose terms?Do expect some untranslated Spanish—but these days we have google translate to make it easier, and it doesn’t distract, but rather adds to the novel.  TJR is a genius in welcoming readers like me, who know squat about tennis but is captivated by the story of what it means to be human—flawed, expectant, hopeful, scared, and served with a beating heart. 4.5\",\n",
       "   \"This book was captivating from the start. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Tennis was never a thing I enjoyed playing or watching. I have never played it and I don't think I've ever watched a whole match on television. Nonetheless, this book held my attention from start to finish.This book not only showed how a sport can change you, but how you can change a sport. Ceilings don't exist in the world of Carrie Soto.Preservation, self determination and dedication, loss (emotional, physical, familial, self), love, fierceness and so much more filled this novel from cover to cover.Taylor Jenkins Reid did her research and went off with this. Truly a page turner.\",\n",
       "   'I read all of Taylor Jenkins Reid\\'s books and I admire how she dives into genre\\xa0 so deeply. This one is the world of tennis, previous ones include music, Hollywood, an ode to Fleetwood Mac. I also admire how there are easter eggs in each book connecting them. If we remember, Carrie Soto first appeared in \"Malibu Rising\".\\xa0I was hoping her story would be more evocative, but it was just kinda a cliche\\xa0ode to tennis stars. If you like the sport though, I highly recommend this book.\\xa0Carrie was a tennis star in the 1980\\'s, and she retires and then comes back to do one last tour. I also admire in all of her books, Reid\\'s clear fangirl for 80s/90s culture. I had to look it up to be sure, and it appears we are both \"Made in the 80\\'s\" (my high school homecoming theme in 2003), and thus this entire period renders intense nostalgia. Anything before 2001 seems magical and simple. Many people forget but we were all prepping for our millennium New Years Party\\'s for like 20 years, and this book definitely captures that Zeitgeist.Also don\\'t tell me you didn\\'t picture like a Jon McEnroe for Bowe Huntley stand in at times. Also lots of digs at Steffi Graff.  I wonder if the character Mel also had a few pro ice skaters in her rerpetoire of the Nagano Olympics?Anyhow, like how \"Malibu Rising\" felt like a fever dream of a John Hughes movie mixed with a Wang Chung music video, so does \"Carrie Soto is Back\" feel like a gatorade commercial and people probably saying \"It\\'s the 90\\'s man (insert dumb idea here).\" Daisy Jones was literally based off the cover of \"The Dance\" and Evelyn Hugo was like Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, and Lana Turner wrapped into one.  I think if you like period genre, then she is now the go-to author for it.',\n",
       "   'I have loved every book I have read by Taylor Jenkins Reid. \"Carrie Soto is Back\" is the best of them all, even better than \"Daisy Jones and the Six.\"  Reid creates characters you really care about. Perhaps this book struck home for me because I currently have a young athletic dog who suffered a career ending injury while I was searching for a new fly ball team for her.  Anyway, this book was full of good people doing their best in a sport they loved.',\n",
       "   'Just a warning, this may contain spoilers. I don’t know what everyone knows.I love Carrie Soto. Not just the book, but the complicated, infuriating woman at the center. She is not easy to like, but dang she is easy to love. When I heard that TJR was doing a book on a minor character from Malibu Rising (a perfectly fine, but not spectacular book), and that it was a character I didn’t even like, I had no idea how that would work. It absolutely does on every level and better than Malibu Rising ever did.There’s just so much to unpack here, but TJR once again world builds like she’s Tolkien translating things into elvish. She’s got to have massive charts devoted to the tennis players and their different playing styles alone.And the climax, which I won’t spoil more than to praise as focusing on the most amazing and satisfying tennis game ever played. I watch very little tennis, but I was literally gasping.Top notch on every level. Highly recommend.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"A visual artist, I was in the market for an author who could supply an imaginative leap inside another species' sensory system.  I thought it could provide perspective on our own, for one thing. Yong provides one simple animal's sensorium by page 7:  a tick is (1) sensitive to body heat, (2) the touch of mammalian hair, and (3) the smell of butyric acid, which comes from skin. That's all it needs. Other creatures have much more elaborate, exotic sensory systems, for finding food, warding off predators, and attracting mates. scientists have devised incredibly ingenious tests to identify and measure animal sensoria, or Umwelten. Yong helps you experience your cat's or dog's Umwelt but dozens more. Why wonder what extraterrestrials might be like, Yong says, when unbelievable sensitivities are here among us and great strides have been made in studying them. Birds who can see ultraviolet rays, mammals sensitive to the slightest vibrations across hundreds of miles, insects attuned to sounds totally out of our range, all manner of marvels are here. Stephen Jay Gould was the high-water mark for me in science writing, but Yong is still better: he's the  liveliest and most gifted communicator I've come across, using colloquialisms, metaphors and analogies ingeniously to vivify his thoughts.  His easy eloquence as big an asset as the totally remarkable information he furnishes here. I worried that all this new information would need to be quite entertaining for an 80-year-old to remain interested, but amazingly, my attention never flagged.\",\n",

This isn’t my usual book choice, but I was continually fascinated by the information presented in this book. He includes so much researchers’ work, interviews, and his own experiences. He includes so many different animals, from mammals to insects.  We are taken on journey through different senses, and how different animals differ in using them or even what senses they are using. It also included that because we are limited to only our perception of reality, we fail to see how what we do affects so many animals around us in detrimental ways.I took my time with this book. I had to read it in shorter bursts, because it is A LOT of information. I feel like my brain grew when reading this. I am so happy that I stuck with it though!

       "  'reviews': ['This is a scary novel. Very scary. And it\\'s not because author Celeste Ng has suddenly written a horror novel. It\\'s frightening because this cautionary dystopian tale of what could happen in the United States has just enough shreds of possibility in it to maybe someday be real. (If it isn\\'t heading that way already.)It\\'s an unknown date in the future. A Crisis (yes capital \"C\") has happened in the United States, but the details of what that means are not offered until midway through the book—so no spoilers here. But the Crisis has upended the country. The most startling results are twofold: In addition to many, many books being banned from libraries and bookstores that are either burned or recycled into toilet paper, everyday people are spying on one another and reporting what they think as suspicious activity to the government. If this happens to parents, the children are summarily removed from their custody, never to be seen again. Books are banned so people won\\'t be damaged by dangerous ideas. And shrouding all of this is a deep-seated hatred and fear of all Asian people, a fear that is enforced by PACT, which stands for Preserving American Culture and Traditions. PACT is supposed to strengthen and unify the nation. People watch what they say. They watch what they do. They watch each other.But not everyone agrees with this repressive, authoritarian government. Some are willing to risk everything to speak out loud—even their children.Ethan Gardner and Margaret Miu are happily married and living in Cambridge, Massachusetts with one child, a little boy they named Noah but nicknamed Bird. When the story opens, Bird is 12 years old. Bird\\'s mom is Chinese-American and a poet. A single line in one of her poems—and not even her best poem!—has become a rallying cry for protesters against the government: All our missing hearts. Margaret was long ago targeted, and when she and Ethan feared Bird would be removed from them, they decided that Margaret would leave and essentially disappear. Ethan would renounce her. It\\'s three years later, and the plan has worked if you don\\'t count the fact that both Ethan and Bird are broken people, who desperately miss Margaret but can never speak her name or share their memories—even with each other. Then one day Bird receives a mysterious drawing of cats from his mother and later finds a strange New York City address. Could he find his mom three years after she has disappeared? Bird\\'s head is filled with the many fairy tales his mother told him as a child, and he realizes he must embark on a similar quest, becoming the hero who endures an ordeal.This is an unputdownable novel where librarians are the quiet heroes and everyday people inflict the most awful violence and injustice on the unsuspecting and innocent. Hmmm…that sounds a lot like where we are today. And this is precisely why this deeply disturbing book is so scary.',\n",
       "   'Twelve-year-old Bird Gardner lives a quiet existence with his loving but broken father, a former linguist who now shelves books in a university library. Bird knows to not ask too many questions, stand out too much, or stray too far. For a decade, their lives have been governed by laws written to preserve “American culture” in the wake of years of economic instability and violence. To keep the peace and restore prosperity, the authorities are now allowed to relocate children of dissidents, especially those of Asian origin, and libraries have been forced to remove books seen as unpatriotic—including the work of Bird’s mother, Margaret, a Chinese American poet who left the family when he was nine years old.Bird has grown up disavowing his mother and her poems; he doesn’t know her work or what happened to her, and he knows he shouldn’t wonder. But when he receives a mysterious letter containing only a cryptic drawing, he is pulled into a quest to find her. His journey will take him back to the many folktales she poured into his head as a child, through the ranks of an underground network of librarians, into the lives of the children who have been taken, and finally to New York City, where a new act of defiance may be the beginning of much-needed change.Our Missing Hearts is an old story made new, of the ways supposedly civilized communities can ignore the most searing injustice. It’s a story about the power—and limitations—of art to create change, the lessons and legacies we pass on to our children, and how any of us can survive a broken world with our hearts intact.My Thoughts:There is something hollow and fearful about Our Missing Hearts as we begin the story of what life was like during the times after the “Crisis.” A time after a stringent law is passed (PACT) that focuses on people supposedly “Anti-American,” but who are mostly Asian. People whose ideas don’t jive with those who are more “in line” with American culture.Primarily we learn more about a family with a child named Bird, a mother who writes poetry but who incidentally is Asian, and a father who works in a library. What happens to this family hurts my heart, and I am feeling the angst of what can happen to families and people because of a law. An unjust law, in my opinion.Fearful of what might lie ahead for any of us kept me reading about these characters and how their lives were torn apart. And how dismantled shelves were the reminders of the books that some considered anti-American. My heart went out to what had become of these characters and what might become of any of us. 4.5 stars.***',\n",
       "   'My first take was that this novel was another one about a pandemic and the aftermath. Yet it is so much more. Underlying all of it is a mother’s love and the development of the main character Margaret and her son Bird.  The political events at first seemed far fetched but the author did draw upon reality.  She describes a very authoritarian state in the US making me picture the period of WWII and the Nazis.  I loved her references to ancient fables throughout to tell her story.  Her son Bird narrates and we see much through an innocent child’s mind.  And playing well was the character of Sadie who shares similar experiences as Bird. Domi, the mother’s friend, and Margrets husband Ethan are used to relate the story but their real characters are a bit shallow.  Recommend to readers who envision a future world that might be if we don’t engage with the direction of cultural freedom.',\n",
       "   'This book is about a family torn apart by circumstances beyond their control. There has been a Crisis - not described in detail but familiar in the age of Covid. As a result laws were enacted - draconian and punitive. The first part of the story is told by Bird. A young boy whose mother has disappeared. As he struggles to make sense of this and hatches a plan. The next part is his mother’s story that culminates in an act of protest.Everything is not tied up in a neat bow at the end - if that’s something you require in a novel - but it’s the ending that makes sense.It’s also a book with a message about history, government and social mores - you’ll recognize the dystopian themes and their roots in our anger and fear - and the importance of listening to and caring about each other.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['I\\'ll admit, I rarely watched \"Friends\" when episodes first aired.  My wife started binge watching it a couple years ago or so, probably during the pandemic, and so I started watching it with her.  I do think that I was a little too hard on the show though as I always thought that it was a bit of a \"Seinfeld\" \"rip-off.\"  In reality there are enough differences in the shows that now, after watching the entire series of each, I\\'ve relaxed my criticism.  A bit.And I rarely read autobiographies, or what people usually call \"memoirs\" nowadays.  I usually am reading true-crime books, in particular those about serial killers.  I did read \"C\\'mon, Get Happy:  Fear and Loathing on the Partridge Family Bus\" (CGH) from David Cassidy in 2021 and I actually liked Mr. Cassidy LESS after reading his memoir.  I kind of wish I wouldn\\'t have read CGH and just remembered him instead from his time on the show.  It\\'s just that I found Mr. Cassidy to be a bit of a braggart while reading and while I finished CGH I was struggling to even care towards the end.  I\\'m guessing that Susan Dey felt the same.  Ahem.Now, rarely does Matthew Perry \"brag\" during \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing:  A Memoir\" (FLB) about himself.  He does discuss how much money he made during filming of \"Friends,\" and I don\\'t have a problem with that, mostly because he discusses how David Schwimmer actually was instrumental in negotiating a great deal for the entire cast and not just for Mr. Schwimmer.  In reality Mr. Perry is far more self-deprecating in FLB than Mr. Cassidy is in CGH.  Mr. Perry doesn\\'t seem to hide much when it comes to his struggles with addiction and if he does underplay it, well, he must be REALLY bad.  Mr. Perry discusses how he was taking up to 55 pain killers a day and that is extreme.  For those who don\\'t know, pain killers tend to dry you out and slow down digestion so I have no idea how someone could take that many for any length of time and survive.Well, Mr. Perry almost didn\\'t survive.Mr. Perry was rushed by a friend from one of his many stints in rehab to the hospital and the people running the rehab facility tried to stop him.  If they had been successful Mr. Perry surely would\\'ve died.  Heck, he still should\\'ve died in the hospital even though he had probably the best care that money could buy.  From memory he said that only \"two percent of people survive on the machine required to keep him alive,\" and I think he also called it a \"Hail Mary.\"Overall I really liked FLB and I actually read it in one day.  As a matter of fact I couldn\\'t sleep last night and kept picking up my Kindle device and would continue reading.  Usually readers might say, \"I couldn\\'t put it down!\" but I might say, \"I couldn\\'t leave it down.\"  Over and over I picked up my device, opened the Kindle app, and continued from my last bookmark.  Luckily for me Kindle apps save the bookmark for me and that\\'s only one of the reasons I tend to almost only read digital.  I will buy a paperback or a hardcover version but only if I MUST read a book and there is no digital version.But still FLB is not a \"perfect book,\" far from it.  Towards the end I think that Mr. Perry starts to repeat himself and I got the feeling that he was on a tight deadline and just hammered out the last few chapters.  I don\\'t know if he first created an outline -- I think that all authors should do so at an early phase in writing -- but I think a good outline would\\'ve really helped create a more polished effort.  It\\'s also the case that Mr. Perry has a tendency to use too many parentheticals and that becomes a bit of a distraction for the reader.Not that it bothers me but it might bother some readers:  Mr. Perry does discuss religion, or at least God, quite a bit towards the end.  If religion is a turnoff, I think that FLB may not be for you.  Mr. Perry does seem to think that God helped keep him alive, maybe even helped him break some addictions, and that is fine by me.  I can\\'t prove it either way, and it is Mr. Perry\\'s memoir, so he has a right to think and write whatever he chooses.  Personally, I appreciate his honesty.Mr. Perry does admit going into open houses and swiping pain meds from home sellers and that reminded me a lot of Ryan Leaf.  I think that Mr. Leaf used to do the same thing and it got that ex-NFL player quite a few years in prison for it.  From a legal standpoint if I were Mr. Perry, and I were writing a memoir, I think I might not have disclosed this.  I am not a lawyer and I don\\'t know what legal troubles it could cause him now.There has been quite a bit of noise about how Mr. Perry tends to \"kiss and tell\" and I think that\\'s overblown a bit.  He does discuss how he and Valerie Bertinelli made out within just a few feet of Eddie Van Halen, after Mr. Van Halen had passed out from drinking too much wine.  Hey, I guess I\\'ve been there myself so I won\\'t judge.  Um, from Mr. Van Halen\\'s perspective and not necessarily from Mr. Perry\\'s.  But Mr. Perry doesn\\'t really dwell on it too much.  I can understand how Ms. Bertinelli feels about the disclosure although of course Mr. Van Halen is no longer with us.  If Mr. Van Halen were still alive I believe that Mr. Perry probably wouldn\\'t even bring it up.  Just a guess.Well, if you\\'re a fan of \"Friends\" and Matthew Perry, and you like to read memoirs, I\\'ll give a fairly strong recommendation for \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.\"  If you don\\'t fit that criteria perhaps you might want to read something else.  But if you\\'re a fan of David Cassidy from \"The Partridge Family\" I\\'ll recommend you pass on his memoir.  Sometimes it\\'s better to only remember the good things about your heroes, after all.',\n",
       "   'Gosh. When Matthew Perry said that he incorporated bits of himself into the role of Chandler Bing, he was so under exaggerating. Not just the sarcasm, not just the failure at women, not just the smoking (good God, the smoking), but, man, every bit of Bing goes a long way from the mind of Matthew.  How he managed to take the stage every episode for 10 years and be completely “ON” will leave you absolutely stunned. And make him even more of a comedic genius than he already was. Because aside from his appearance (in his own words, skinny meant pills, fat meant booze) it would be virtually unnoticeable as his performances were never affected.This book really leaves you with a “I don’t know what how to feel about this book” feeling at the end of it. For the most part due to the way it just jumps all over the place in terms of time and sheer self-destruction. One minute you’re rooting for MP as he achieves his hopes and dreams of sitcom super (or, “stupor”) stardom. To the next minute wanting to go up to the Hollywood Hills (or whatever house he’s living in this month, he changes houses like people change socks) and slap him in the head and say, “What the hell is the Matthew matter with you!”That being said, it’s not like any of this went undocumented back in the day. No matter the amount of trouble he found himself in, there’s no way that I couldn’t read this, as I consider Perry in the same upper echelon ranks of physical comedic performer as a John Ritter. And has always reminded me delivery wise of a Michael Keaton (whom he cites as his favorite actor, by the way, so I guess that makes sense).  What he brought as a performer, and not just Chandler but everything he does, is an inherent (or inherited?) ability to not just expertly time his lines and incorporate a facial reaction, but his particular physical movements were something to behold.  Never forced, never stolen, it was all him with the gesture of an arm or breaking into a pee-inducing dance of hilarity, he was of the Michael J Fox (another guy he mentions in his book) school of comedy: you give the guy one joke, he gets three laughs.I mean, I go back with this guy as a viewer. From his minor role in A Night in the life of Jimmy Reardon, to when he died on Growing Pains. Which I found a bit of a disappointment, that he never mentioned his time on that show. Especially for somebody who suffers from such a horrendous alcohol addiction, as his character actually drunk drove himself into the hospital and subsequently dies, leading to one of the  more disquieting moments in the show’s history when his death is revealed.Now, addiction is addiction, but the almost braggadocios way he wears it like a badge of honor becomes nearly unbearable.  He nearly turns it into a drinking game. Every time he says he took 55 Vicodin, you take a shot. Every time he says he got scared of being close to a woman and ditched her, take a shot. Every time he tells you how beloved Friends is and that he changed the vernacular of the entire country (which I lived through and do not remember), take a shot. You’ll be dead before chapter 12.There are numerous moments of uplifting achievements, which are only to be negated a sentence later due to utter lunacy and illogical reason.  It qualifies him as something of a medical marvel because they ARE of reason to an addict.  The bit about scavenging the homes for sale I thought was his dastardly pinnacle. But the flying back and forth to Switzerland officially reaches evil genius status and definitely takes the cake (or flan). And just when you think he is on the right track he derails just one more time into the same repetitive, self-destructive patterns again and again.  Which brings the book to its most aggravating aspect as it becomes so incredibly redundant about only halfway through. Even to the point where either Perry while in writing mode was still sifting through his lucid moments, or it was his editor who was the one popping pills. Because several passages word for word (including the infamous Keanu Reeves statement) get repeated a handful of times throughout the book to where YOU end up screaming at your Kindle, “is it him or am I the one who’s crazy??”But as far as the uplifting stuff there’s, of course, his relocation from Canada in his teens and his slow-burn rise to fame with all of the 80s either guest appearances or failed pilots. Right to the point of the Chandler audition, which actually cost him a close friendship because a buddy of his was up for the part, resulting in the two not speaking for three years.  Ah, but then comes the fun house of fame, fortune and f***king (LOTS of f***ing f***ing. I think he banged more girls than Joey!), all of which he doesn’t fail to mention to you at least once a chapter as to the quantity of how much brain he gave away.And, in the biggest “Yet” of “Yets,” somehow ends up at his laptop in the modern day telling us this exact story, even after a years-of-abuse perforated bowel that nearly killed him. Which can only leave you in the end so very concerned for his future, a future that he’s really drawn up for himself in terms of eventually finding solid love and having babies. Though only 53, who knows how much of that future he will actually see.So, Mr. Matthew Langford Perry, aka Chandler Muriel Bing, thank you for opening up to us. Even if it did re-define the very picture of hopeless and awkward and desperate for love (his words, not mine).']},\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"In only a couple of chapters, it becomes obvious that Bono didn't hire a ghost writer and that this is no mere vanity project. Just like his lyrics, the writing is prose punctuated with beautiful passages, world views, and poignant experiences. His ego comes through (and, according to the book, he is well aware that he is an egotist), but I was struck with what a self-reflective and humble person he can be. The book plumbs the depths of and dependence on the love and connection he feels with his wife, children, band, and God. His God is an activist God and he makes no apologies for using his position as a bona fide rock star to try to make the world a better place. While this could come off as superior and preachy, it doesn't in this book. He readily admits to miscalculations, naivete, and being used by powerful political forces. I enjoyed the book so much more than I expected. It gave me a peek into the man behind the persona and I liked the man better. It also reignited my interest in his music as the 40 songs selected and referenced heavily in the book are put into the context of what he and U2 were experiencing and how they were growing individually and collectively as they wrote and/or performed the songs. A great read about a man who has moved through many phases of life in a very public way but, as with our own lives, the truth behind the public image is far more interesting when the mask itself. Bono Vox is silenced and Paul David Hewson's voice is allowed to speak in this extraordinary book and, as you can imagine, his extraordinary life has led to extraordinary stories. But, more importantly, he is astute and reflective enough to learn from those stories and offer extraordinary insights into what the stories mean for him and the people who share his life, including those people who love his music.\",\n",
       "   'This book obliterated by expectations, which were high since U2 has been my favorite band since the mid-80s and Bono someone I truly admire beyond his role as U2 lead man. I purchased the book shortly after its release and enjoyed reading it. However, I recently have been listening to the audiobook version which takes it to another level. Simply outstanding! If you are at all interested in this book, do be sure to listen to the audiobook version. Anyway, this book is at times laugh out loud funny, often deep and even poignant, full of wisdom, and other times so tender and touching that my eyes were getting misty. Truly one of the best books I have read (any genre). Thank-you Bono for the painstaking effort that went into this. Would a non-superfan of U2 get as much out of it? Probably not. But the lessons about growing up, faith, and even politics are universal and very current and needed, whether you love U2 or not. But I do love U2 and their music has meant so much to me over the years, and that context certainly adds to the enjoyment of the book and understanding of so many little references that I think you have to know the music to get. So, bottom line, I would recommend this to anyone. But I highly recommend this to anyone who loves U2.',\n",
       "   'I tend to navigate to books from rock stars as I have always found that most of these musicians could also have been novelists. Keith Richards, Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend and Rod Stewart all come to mind. Incredible autobiographies that chronicle their upbringing in often difficult circumstances and their subsequent rise to fameI like a lot of Bono and U2’s songs but have never been a big fan. And yet, I love the book he has written as it fits in well with the aforementioned.Bono employs a different idea in the construction of this book, using a song title as a theme for each chapter and then filling in the blanks with deep insights, anecdotes and stories of his and/or the band’s pastYou don’t have to be a U2 fan to enjoy the book and his style, as there are numerous stories of his own personal battles and the initiatives he has undertaken. Bono writes in a personal style that naturally leads to an empathetic response from the readerIt’s not a short book, but the chapters fly by.I highly recommend the book to anyone who like rock or wishes to read about a man who overcame obstacles to succeed in life.  And moreover, a man who is sensitive to the needs of many in this world and who, with his wife, have put a great deal of time and effort in to help with numerous causes',\n",
       "   'This book does a great job of peering into the mind of Bono and the inside life of U2. WOW! These band mates have been friends for long time and it\\'s good to see how friendship is more important than just \"playing music\".  I am amazed at the twist and turns of life that made U2 who they are today.  The trauma, heartache, and success has come and influenced their music and their lives.  May their music continue to impact people. \"One\"!',\n",
       "   'I am not a \"celebrity worshipper\", having known many, met many, admire a few but more for their work as many I don\\'t know them personally. In reading \"Surrender\", without sounding mushy, truth is Bono\\'s sparked an appreciation deep into my artist\\'s soul. I am convinced creative souls (I personally believe we all are in some capacity🕊️) will resonate with the book as well. Bono\\'s gift for writing is so engaging I have a hard time focusing on my own creative business & daily life and my reading time has become very limited but when I am truly captivated by a book such as \"Surrender\" I carve some time. It\\'s like a teenage crush, ya can\\'t wait to spend time together again, and soon! 💕My youngest brother was into U2 from the very beginning; he exposed me to their music and when they became the huge act they are now, I remember him saying \"hope the quality of their music never changes\"... I never grew into the Super fan that he is but I must say reading the book I have a completely different perspective and a whole new appreciation for their work and them as individuals. It\\'s one thing to read a review or article in a music magazine or such but when you read first person accounts it colors the perspective tremendously and I have been recommending \"Surrender\" for fans especially but even just as a great read.Thank you, Bono for sharing your memories with the rest of us.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['Brava, Maggie O\\' Farrell!!  I read \"Hamnet\" with such great delight that I scrambled to read \"The Marriage Portrait.\"  The deftness with which Ms. O\\'Farrell transported me to the courts of 16th century Florence and Ferrara was remarkable, but most astonishing is her extraordinary ability to breathe such life, spirit and dimension into her protagonists, leaving one to feel that if Lucrezia de Medici walked in the room, one would be impelled to run over and lock her in a giant embrace (which wouldn\\'t be appropriate for the times, but...)',\n",
       "   \"I am a HUGE fan of Maggie O'Farrell. I've read and loved all of her present-day fiction and her recent memoir. And while I didn't share the adulation Hamnet seemed to bring out in so many, it was well-written and fascinating in its own right and a good enough read. So I hate to say that I found The Marriage Portrait a big disappointment, but it was a slog to read on many levels. While I didn't fully agree with the mean-spirited review the book got in The New York Times, I do agree the novel is over-written with a forced kind of lyricism that O'Farrell never demonstrated in the past. The descriptions do seem over-wrought at times and even Lucrezia's character comes off as inconsistent: tough and independent as a child, timid and almost insipid post-marriage. I suspect O'Farrell had to make some tough creative decisions to spin a tale out of such thin cloth in terms of actual history. Little is known of Lucrezia other than her birth, marriage and early death, so the split narrative -- before and after her marriage -- was likely the most compelling way to try to tell the story, but that made the book disorienting and somewhat repetitive. The ending did come as a surprise, even if it wasn't entirely realistic, but nice to imagine a kinder fate for that young woman. I did read the entire novel, mostly because of my affection for the author and her work, but it took me quite a while to finish the book, not because it was long, but because it was hard to sink into the prose and story. I hope O'Farrell returns to her modern-day roots where she's never hit a false note, at least for this reader.\",\n",
       "   'I loved Maggie O\\'Farrell\\'s novel Hamnet so when her latest book was published, I was anxious to read it. I found it not nearly as engrossing as Hamnet, which I could not put down. Conversely, this one felt like a slog...I read a few pages a day and that seemed to be enough. I can\\'t figure out why that was...it was beautifully written, had a dramatic storyline, and plenty of palace intrigue. Then again, on further thought, I didn\\'t feel any compatibility with any of the characters: the 15-year-old bride Lucrezia, her bold and controlling husband Alfonso, her jealous sister, conniving sisters-in-law, uncaring parents...none of them were the least bit sympathetic.While Lucrezia is a character to be worried about and to feel sorry for, she is also a character I could not relate to. And, without the \"rooting\" effect, I found myself at a loss as to why I continued to read about her journey. In addition, I loathed her parents and siblings. I know these are different times but, really, what kind of parents allow their 13-year-old daughter to be betrothed to a man in his 20s? What kind of parents silence a young child who has artistic talent and a curious mind, ignore her choices, and send her to a prison of sorts in a marriage that she doesn\\'t understand or want?I have no problem understanding that people from different times behaved very differently from our current society and I am an avid reader of historical fiction because I love learning about different times and cultures.But this novel, its characters, and its subject matter didn\\'t sit well with me.',\n",
       "   'Incredibly detailed and comprehensive descriptions of scenes virtually devoid of any action. Roughly 320 pages of the 340 page novel contain lengthy, vivid descriptions while maybe 20 pages in total contain a fragment to move the story forward. A frustrating read.',\n",
       "   'This was my second Maggie O’Farrell novel, the first being the acclaimed “Hamnet.” That book, like this one was masterfully written, and it is O’Farrell’s writing that I am most in awe of. “Hamnet” seemed to channel the Bard himself, and this one, “The Marriage Portrait” had hints of a fairy tale in its style. Being a former English teacher, I am always on the lookout for books that not only tell a good tale but are well written too. That said, it seems like O’Farrell in both books is on something of a crusade to combat paternalism. Men take a pretty good beating in both books, maybe deservedly so. And, yes, I am a man, so perhaps it is gender paranoia on my part. I did enjoy this book and for the first time in a long time, I anxiously awaited the end to see what would happen. Without giving any spoilers away, it is worth the wait and not necessarily predictable. It’s a well crafted and sufficiently clever finale for an admirable novel. Speaking of its genre, O’Farrell has a section after the conclusion explaining what parts of the story actually happened and what parts were changed and for what reasons.',\n",
       "   'This book was interesting and suspenseful but it was hard to follow the plot as the tale was told with numerous flashbacks and switches among locations. As a result I would call it a \"page-turner\", but a lot of the page turning was back and forth, trying to figure out what was going on.',\n",
       "   'In the beginning the story jumps around and becomes confusing, it does eventually become a consistent story line. It is hard to tell if you are following a young raving women not based in logic or are you following a woman under attack. It adds to the suspense but it does leave you wondering at the end how the story finishes.',\n",
       "   'I could not put this book down from page one. Absolutely thrilling and fast paced. I enjoyed reading about her transformation from a silly and strange child to a powerful Duchess fighting for her life. This is the first novel I’ve read from Maggie O’Farrell but it will not be my last.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['I am a big fan of both Meacham and Lincoln.  I believe that “And There Was Light” is a truthful, unbiased nonfiction account of American history that deserves five stars.  Abraham Lincoln guided our nation through its most perilous times.  I read the hardback version and it worked well with my reading glasses.  The story flowed smoothly from start to finish and was a very good read. I think this book should be part of every high school history/civics curriculum with a student evaluation prior to graduation.To be clear, Abraham Lincoln’s vision was the union without slavery. His was the just and honorable cause to align our values with those described in the Declaration of Independence – all men are created equal with the very basic human rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  This cause was patriotic and defined America.  His goal was accomplished but only after the American Civil War claimed an estimated 750,000 combatants.  In retrospect and very simply stated, the confederate cause was unjust, dishonorable, unpatriotic and morally offensive.  The just cause prevailed and the union was restored.  However, the confederates chose to replace slavery with white supremacy and segregation. White supremacy was, is and always will be domestic terrorism in political, social and economic terms and strategies.  Even today, it also often delivers both overt/covert discrimination, harassment and physical violence. It is unamerican and not patriotic.As Meacham wraps up his book, Lincoln is described as having had the following leadership qualities: “absolute truth, stern resolution, clear insight, solemn faithfulness, courage that cannot be daunted and hopefulness that cannot be dashed.”  I would only add that Abraham Lincoln was a unique, tireless, selfless servant to our nation, its laws and We the People.  He gave the last full measure and we all (past, present and future citizens) should be eternally grateful for his sacrifice.  To sound the clarion call in 2023, there is a sizeable minority amongst us and in our government bodies.  This modern day white supremist, right wing conservative movement is neither patriotic nor American.  It was clearly on display at our nation’s Capital on January 6th.  It is the essence of pure evil.  It is a clear and present danger and there is no Lincoln like American hero/leader to get our democratic republic experiment back on track to shine the light of hope and liberty across the world.Footnote:My family and I were finally notified to appear before the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of North Carolina in Fayetteville, NC on 11/30/1966.  This to be the final task to obtain our US citizenship.  It had taken 2 years and some money to get to this point. The presiding judge was Samuel A. Howard. We appeared before him separately. His duty was to evaluate our ability to speak and comprehend English.  His question to me: “Who was Abraham Lincoln?” My response was: “Abraham Lincoln was the President of the United States who freed the slaves.”  His response: “No, that is not correct. Abraham Lincoln saved the union.” My response: “Why yes, he did but he also freed the slaves. Was I now disqualified for citizenship?” He replied: \"No, you are not disqualified.\"  Later that day, he administered the oath and we became US citizens.  That is one pursuit that I have never regretted.',\n",
       "   'In \"And There Was Light,\" Jon Meacham takes on another iconic American in Abraham Lincoln. Meacham won the Pulitzer Prize for his earlier treatment of Andrew Jackson in American Lion, and regularly makes the bestseller lists with his biographies. Thus, it should be no surprise that with a book subtitled, \"Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle,\" Meacham finds himself again highly touted for his work.The praise is, of course, deserved. Technically, the book is a biography of Lincoln’s life, but essentially it is also a commentary on Lincoln’s values, the struggles he overcame to go from frontier farm boy to president of the United States, and more importantly, how those values fell into conflict with the defining issue of the day – slavery. As he progresses through life, Lincoln’s integrity, sense of fairness, and desire to “better his condition” dovetail with the nation’s struggle to uphold those venerated words from the Declaration of Independence, “all men are created equal.” To Lincoln, these words were the heart of Americanism. Southern slaveholders had a different view, especially after the Missouri Compromise made it clear that the federal government considered slavery no better than “a necessary evil” whose expansion should be curtailed. To the slave powers, slavery became not an evil but “a positive good” and “a national benefit.”As Meacham takes us through Lincoln’s life, he shows his growth as a politician as well as in his humanity. Lincoln never demonizes slaveholders but does clearly state that slavery is immoral. More and more he speaks out against slavery, struggling to find a way to arrest the spread of the institution in such a way as to put it on a path toward its ultimate extinction, all while understanding that federal authority to take action was constrained by the Constitution. Eventually he is elected president on the platform of restricting expansion but not acting against slavery in states where it already existed. And still there was secession and war as slave powers would not take hands off for an answer. The only way to satisfy them, Lincoln notes, is to “cease to call slavery wrong and join them in calling it right…in acts as well as in words. Silence will not be tolerated—we must place ourselves avowedly with them.” This was a bridge too far.To question slavery, in slaveholders’ minds, was to question the white South’s values, faith, and intelligence. Slavery was integral to the Southern way of life. Limit slavery and you limit the reach of white Southerners, according to Meacham. And thereby is the crux that remains so today. How does one defend an evil? By simply relabeling it as a good. Lincoln understood that such self-deceptions were ingrained, not just with the wealthy who believed they deserved their privilege, but with the poor whites who believed they had more in common with rich whites than poor blacks. How to resolve this inherent self-deception? This conflict between reality and delusion? Meacham doesn’t answer this because there is no good answer, either in Lincoln’s time or our own. But Lincoln understood that the value of “all men are created equal” was worth striving for because a nation to be saved must be a nation worth saving. As abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison observed after the assassination, those like him who had struggled for the end of slavery for so long thought “Mr. Lincoln has seemed exceedingly slow in all his emancipatory measures…Yet what long strides he has taken in the right direction, and never a backward step.” In Meacham’s treatise, he seems to be asking us in the modern age to continue striving forward, relying on Lincoln’s strength to not take any backward steps in the struggle to reach that more perfect union that has thus far eluded us.David J.

       "   'From the outset, it\\'s clear that Mitchun has a deep and abiding reverence for Abraham Lincoln, and this comes through in the meticulous research and attention to detail that he brings to his subject. The book is a comprehensive examination of Lincoln\\'s life, from his humble beginnings to his rise to the presidency and the ultimate sacrifice he made for his country.What sets \"And There Was Light\" apart from other works on Lincoln is the way that Mitchun situates the president within the larger context of American history. Mitchun deftly weaves in discussions of the Civil War, the abolitionist movement, and other key events and figures of the time, showing how Lincoln\\'s actions and decisions were shaped by the complex political and social landscape of the era.Despite its length and scholarly tone, \"And There Was Light\" is an accessible and engaging work that will appeal to both casual readers and serious students of history. The writing is clear and compelling, and Mitchun\\'s passion for his subject shines through on every page.Overall, \"And There Was Light\" is a masterful work of historical scholarship that provides a rich and nuanced portrait of Abraham Lincoln and the world in which he lived. It\\'s a must-read for anyone interested in American history or the life of one of its most iconic figures.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['As someone well into their senior years, I have been very fortunate to have had a full life filled with happiness, joy, adventure, danger, unbearable sorrow, and of course lots of love.  One of the things that have kept me sane was my voracious love of books.After I read this author’s book “Quiet” and liked it, I decided to also read Susan Cain’s Bitter-sweet, which I purchased on Amazon.  I enjoyed and liked her book “Quiet” but I really loved this book, Bitter-sweet.  Even though more women will probably like this book than men readers; however, as someone who is inside my consciousness a true romantic, I related too many of the emotions and feelings this book invokes within your soul.Indeed, songs can often make me both sad and happy depending on the memories that are imprinted on my mind and heart.  I think many times that some people might find me strange because I look forward to cloudy, cool, rainy days of autumn more so than the hot, sweaty days of summer.I admit finding this book very revealing and interesting when it comes to some of the hidden emotions, we sometimes have that often come spilling out at various times.  I have learned to accept the simple truth in the saying, “do not expect life to be fair, because life just is.”  As flawed human beings, as the famous song (Sunrise Sunset) says, “one season following another, filled with happiness and tears.”I loved this book and if you are a fan of Susan Cain’s books you should checkout this one.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Zen Poetry Moments: Haiku and Senryu for special occasions).',\n",
       "   'I had read Cain\\'s  first book Quiet when it was first published, so it was a given, for me, to read this one. There is so much in this book to unpack,both for your mind and your heart.

You laugh and you cry with her and the line between bitter and sweet, sorrow and longing, grief and impermanence, death is a window, not a wall.  It is a good journey into the bittersweet.',\n",

The rest of the book, however, spent a lot of time giving detailed accounts of experiences she and others had that illustrated the points made in the first few chapters.',\n",

       "  'reviews': ['This extremely well written and informative book is about  cells, “organs and systems—organs that perform discrete functions (kidneys, hearts, livers) and systems of cells (immune cells, neurons) that enable these functions.”  It ranges from history of science to cutting age discoveries and their implications for medical treatment.  Fortunately for me at least, the history concentrates on how the discoveries were made, with limited, mostly interesting anecdotes; perhaps there could have been even less on the totally incorrect ideas.  For how more recent discoveries were made, the author has a talent for including just enough detail to inform without overwhelming.  He does the same with the human immune system, well perhaps a bit too much detail.  One of the problems with the immune system was the need to evolve multiple, distinct checks on the activation of T cells – to prevent autoimmune diseases, although obviously we still have some.Following are a few cutting age discoveries, not always completely accepted yet.  Chemical neurotransmitters, like Serotonin,  have “slow” effects  with “profound biochemical and metabolic changes in the recipient” neuron, as well as the commonly accepted fast effects for propagating nerve signals.  Given that science still does not understand how Serotonin and the like impact depression, or even how general anesthetics work, I can anticipate an explosion of work elaborating on this conclusion.Osteoarthritis is commonly thought to result from the wear and tear on cartilage, but the real problem is likely one of diminished repair - “the cells that form cartilage in joints decay dramatically with age”; work is underway to combat this decay.“Fetal blood cells therefore carry a unique form of hemoglobin—fetal hemoglobin—that is especially designed to extricate oxygen in the (low oxygen) fetal environment;”  work is underway to capitalize on this to cure sickle cell anemia, since apparently that disease dos not impact the fetal blood cells.Finally, this is hardly cutting age, but baby aspirin is given to many heart patients because “Aspirin, at low doses, blocks the key enzyme that produces these injury-sensing chemicals, thereby decreasing platelet activation and subsequent clots.”',\n",
       "   'Siddhartha Mukherjee, one of our age’s most brilliant medical writers, is a cancer doctor with research interests in the basic sciences of cell biology and genetics. He is also an engaging writer with a deep knowledge of the history of science. His books, one of which has won a Pulitzer Prize, combine all these crosscurrents to convey a compelling narrative. He’s done it for both genetics and cancer, and here, he hits another home run writing about cell biology.In this book, he describes the long history of this field and how it has given us more understanding about our bodies’ various facets. He describes how cell biology has impacted various organ systems and translates knowledge of basic science to clinical effects. He also describes patient stories of contemporary impacts of research and cutting-edge research trials that hope to impart new wisdom to the medical establishment.In this and other works, I’ve read few other authors who can make the history of medicine come alive to the same degree as Mukherjee. His passion for the subject combines many aspects, including stories about scientists’ personal lives, scientific details that have huge impacts on patients (i.e., all of us), and ethical challenges of managing biological innovations.This book contains a lot of biological knowledge and healthcare experience. Reading about biology is not for the feint of heart. But his prose makes the process enjoyable. Aspiring healthcare workers and biological researchers will benefit from perusing its pages. It can teach a bunch about cell biology while keeping the reader mentally and spiritually engaged. This book provides us with a fun way to learn more about our bodies so that we don’t fall asleep in the process.',\n",
       "   'Having read and enjoyed the authors past two books (The Emperor of all Maladies and The Gene), I eagerly awaited his most recent book, The Song of the Cell. The book doesn’t disappoint. For many of us who studied biology in high school, this book covers a lot of familiar terrain. But this isn’t a textbook. Mukherjee possesses a storyteller’s instinct, and the book moves forward propelled by a cast of characters straight out of a Dicken’s novel.Staring from the Dutch trader Leeuwenhoek peering into his crude microscope to examine the tiny organisms in drain water to the eccentric German physician Rudolf Virchow who’s free thinking led to the advancement of cellular medicine, the book is replete with amazing scientists whose curiosity and thirst for knowledge has made these wondrous breakthroughs in medicine possible. Reading this book, one realizes how much we take for granted. How complicated the human body is and how magical its operation. Also noteworthy are the thousands of unsung scientists who for years have toiled away (and continue to toil) on lab-benches to enable all the many discoveries that make our present lives so much easier.Culling stories from his personal and professional life, Mukherjee weaves his tale deftly while explaining complex concepts of cell biology with verve and clarity. The dude clearly loves his subject matter!My biggest quibble with this book is the lack of clear illustrations. There are some, but they are not particularly helpful. I still can’t figure out where the damn Gremlin cells are located – somewhere in the bones – can you?Towards the end of the book, Mukherjee touches on Homeostasis, the ability of the human body to reset itself to “factory settings”. This January 2023, the average temperature in New York City has been 10 degrees above normal. The warmest January on record. Our planet is running a fever, and alas mankind has screwed up the planet’s homeostatic functions. I hope for humanity’s sake, there are a band of motivated citizens who help us reset the planet’s systems back to its “factory settings”. Reading “The Song of the Cell” would be a good place to start!']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['The pettiness of our qualms – our political, social, and personal qualms – are both dwarfed and made more apparent by the natural grandiosity of the universe at large. Tyson has made a career and codified a philosophy of this message. There is something about the sweeping indifference of it all, the ego-shattering disinterest of the cosmic perspective that is at once both frightful and also unbelievably freeing. As many other great scientists have noted, the fact that the universe is knowable at all, and that we are around and capable to know it, is beautiful. Tyson notes, “No message written on tablets in the sky pre-required this to be so. It just is. For me, this summit of objective truth makes the universe itself the most beautiful thing in the universe.” Given this, Tyson does something with this latest effort that he has traditionally avoided in the past, which is to speak on pressing social or cultural issues that beset the present moment. Other generalized topics are addressed as well, but the great astrophysicist and science expositor attempts to imbue our terrestrial and human problems with a cosmic perspective – looking at these issues with a broader, grander view of our reality. Although not always successful in this endeavor (even the smartest of us can miss the forest for the trees), Tyson does generally impart a healthy, fresh perspective to these areas of interest, perhaps a puzzling project given his prior avoidance of jumping into the fray – but one that is still decidedly characteristic of his deeper interest in the universe. And so, in a way, we get Tyson’s Greatest Hits.It is probably a fitting place to start that he begins the book by discussing truth and beauty and how, namely, cold indifferent truths can themselves be beautiful. This may contrast with our traditional view of beauty, which lies squarely in the subjective realm. But Tyson’s view here does not contradict that traditional sentiment; it merely adds another dimension, a broader view. “Objective truths apply to all people, places, and things, as well as all animals, vegetables, and minerals. Some of these truths apply across all of space and time. They are true even when you don’t believe in them.” The universality of objective truth, then, makes it attractive. The point, though, is that the attractiveness of truth is neither here nor there. And, ironically, this makes truth beautiful in a cosmic way. He goes on to sinch the point: “Objective truths of science are not founded in belief systems. They are not established by the authority of leaders or the power of persuasion. Nor are they learned from repetition or gleaned from magical thinking. To deny objective truths is to be scientifically illiterate, not to be ideologically principled.” In other words, ignoring basic facts does not make one strong-willed in any morally or practically useful way. The question may arise – as it did on Lawrence Krauss’s podcast, Origins, with the two in conversation – about science changing or modifying our ideas of truth. To this Tyson answers (perhaps unsatisfactorily) that objective truth should not be confused with absolute truth, adding for good measure that Newtonian principles will never be upended.One more important piece to note about his chapter on truth and beauty is that while “personal truths” can be healthy in navigating the human condition, we should be careful not to conflate them with objective truths. “Social, political, or legislative attempts to require that everybody agree with your personal truths are ultimately dictatorships.” He rightly fears our devaluing objective science in lieu of subjective zealotry.Tyson goes on to offer general insights in chapters like “Exploration & Discovery” and “Earth & Moon.” Particularly, there is one moving passage that bookends his adumbration of global political strife and poverty, instead taking a cosmic overview of these problems. “I can know all this intellectually for having read about it, but when I confront it from above, with details stripped away, I don’t see the politics, the history, the skin colors, the languages, the bigotry, the racism, the protests. I’m instead plagued by a simpler thought that, as a species, we might not possess the maturity or wisdom the future requires to assure the survival of civilization.” When framed in such stark terms, it should give us all pause for contemplation. We are, in the end, a species vying for survival, and perhaps fighting only against ourselves on a planet possessed of its own survival.Veering into social and cultural territory, Tyson finds less success in making a solid case for the “cosmic perspective.” His ultimate goal here, admirably, is to show that when it comes to gender, race, and identity, we are all more alike than different. This is, perhaps, the sort of ecumenical view the world needs. Unfortunately, though, he seems intent on ignoring some objective truths that he so strongly defends earlier in the book. While gender is fluid and exists on a continuum, sex is not. We know certain objective differences to be true generally of men and women, and not just phenotypically but also in reference to potentialities and even interests and dispositions. Tyson does not exactly reject this, but elides much of it for his personal view of this issue. He even peddles in blatant contradictions when it comes to the chapter on race. Although he rightly – but unoriginally – bemoans the history of black and brown disenfranchisement, he goes on to offer a full-fisted irony when it comes to the weird issue of removing “offensive” statues. Tyson seemingly offers a robust and fair historical defense of Teddy Roosevelt and a particular statue of him, but then strangely notes that he is glad it was taken down. What follows his full account of this history – his broad or “cosmic” vantage point – is this odd and fully contradictory statement: “Remembering too that our opinions take shape on an ever-shifting landscape of social and cultural mores. A full perspective on the statue leaves me happy to see it removed, only because nobody would conceive of such a statue today, which is the litmus test for any indictment I seek.” This sentiment is an abomination to historians and those who wish to preserve the full richness of the past, with full regard to past moral atrocities (and perhaps especially to that which may be morally ambiguous). He then goes on. “My urge is to gesture a forgiving nod to the past while I display a furrowed brow to the future, wondering how today’s most progressive creations may appear to our ever-more-enlightened descendants a hundred years from now.” The reader may be hard-pressed to believe the same author penned these two distinct ideas mere sentences apart. Even physicists can get it wrong (perhaps especially when it deals with matters outside their wheelhouse, namely of hard, objective facts).Much of this book, however, is uplifting. In his coda on life and death, Tyson offers some beautiful thoughts. When contemplating the very essence of life and death, he says, “…but maybe the knowledge of death creates the focus that we bring to being alive. […] There is perhaps no greater de-motivating force than the knowledge you will live forever.” As others have said, life is only special because it ends. As natural as it is to cling to religious notions of an eternal afterlife, it becomes an ugly wish upon fuller investigation. “It is better to be alive than dead. Though more often than not, we take being alive for granted.” This is why it is important to see a grander or cosmic view of our reality. Inspired, he continues. “Being alive is the time to celebrate being alive – every waking moment.”With this in view, Tyson closes his book and his most recent effort to impart the majesty of life and, quite literally, the universal view of taking part in it. He compels the reader to ask himself if he has made any positive contribution to humanity while alive. “On the whole, I don’t fear death. Instead, I fear a life where I could have accomplished more.” We can all do better. We can all offer more hope to humanity. We can all live a more fulfilled life where “curiosity and wonder, the twin chariots of cosmic discovery, will ensure that starry messages continue to arrive.”Objective truth is essential, but so is the depth and heaviness of our hearts. And we only get one life. He closes with this hauntingly breathtaking observation: “We get to invoke our faculties of reason to figure out how the world works. But we also get to the smell the flowers. We get to bask in divine sunsets and sunrises, and gaze deeply into the night skies they cradle. We get to live, and ultimately die, in this glorious universe.”Curiosity and wonder are always profound places to start.',\n",
       "   'Starry Messenger, Cosmic Perspective on Civilization by Neil deGrasse Tyson (Henry Holt and Company, 2022)An interesting book that seems to have two overriding themes: first, appreciate and even consider acting more like a scientist. We are encouraged to be more open-minded and guided by “facts” only after actionable belief is subjected to exposure, testing and peer review. Secondly, it would help for us to think in other than binary terms, even though it is in our nature to do so. Much of what we view as either one thing or another can be deceptive. Our inclination to think in binary terms blinds us to the reality that much of the life we live and encounter exists as part of a vast spectrum, with innumerable and nuanced aspects.Some of the book smacks of mild conceit, such as when he relates how it took him 73 seconds to solve a Rubik’s cube.  I say this because he was comparing his performance to that of a super-computer. Regardless, his stories are worthwhile.  My favorite story concerns one of the three times he was excluded from serving on a jury. It was a criminal trial, and he made the penultimate cut for selection to the jury. The judge asked if any of the remaining potential jurors had any questions. Tyson raised his hand and asked why the judge told them that the defendant is charged with possession of 1700 milligrams of coke, instead of saying that he is charged with 1.7 grams, which is a more accurate description (since the thousand in 1700 and \"mil\" in milligrams cancel one another out). Of course, he was implicitly saying that the former characterization suggests a very large quantity to the uninformed juror, which would likely produce bias. Not surprisingly, he was excused once again from serving as a jury member.He does an excellent job in his treatment of disabilities, citing examples of people who have excelled in spite of what are commonly viewed as disabilities. He queries if Stephen Hawking was really disabled, given his proficiency in science and whether, when compared to his intellect and accomplishments, is it we or most of us who should be considered disabled? He cites to Helen Keller, Jim Abbott (the Yankee pitcher with only one hand who pitched a no-hitter against Cleveland), and others who excelled, regardless of what would generally be considered as having a debilitating trait. He takes this one step further and compares our capabilities to other living organisms on this planet. Within the animal kingdom, our natural capabilities are far from ideal when it comes to our somewhat deficient five senses. Yes, but what about our big brains? We do not even possess the largest brains in the animal world (whales, elephants and dolphins have bigger brains). And who is to say that ants are not conscious? He refers to the mycelium network under trees as the \"Wood Wide Web.\" What makes our inter-communication more important than the obvious communications that go on underground?With regard to race and gender identity, he effectively makes the case that there is a vast spectrum that must be considered relevant and acted upon in order to fully appreciate the vast \"continuum\" of human nature. His Chapter Four, entitled Conflict & Resolution, is a worthwhile read as well. He does a deep dive into what he refers to as standard Democratic and Republican tropes regarding one or the other party. He calls out unfair generalizations on both sides. Groups like Braver Angels make it their mission to promote conversations along these lines. Two examples:Example 1: “Conservatives value the nuclear family and the stability it brings to civilization, unlike liberals, who live under questionable moral codes.”Retort: “Nearly half of all babies born in the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and South Carolina are born to unmarried women…The corresponding rates for the famously blue states…are half that.”Example 2: “Liberals occupy the high ground on science while conservatives embrace science deniers,”Retort: “Other than climate change and modern biology, there’s very little else about science in America that conservatives deny…Okay. Then what about the liberals themselves? Turns out the following list of beliefs and practices lands squarely in their corral: crystal healing, therapeutic touch, feather energy, magnetic therapy, homeopathy, astrology, anti-GMO, anti-pharma.”Finishing up with what an alien reaction to our existence might be, he reminds us that we, as humans, share 98% of our DNA make-up with chimps. He goes on to explain that the 2% does make, and has made, an enormous difference in our evolutionary progress, social relations, inventions and built environment. But then he goes on to speculate. What if aliens visiting earth were to have a genetic structure enhanced beyond our own, with a similar difference of 2%? In that event, we would be viewed, with all of our achievements, as little more than children or worse, inferior animals to be exploited for the benefit of the aliens.All of these musings and stories are intended to help us think about life and living in a more objective, reasoned way. As an attorney who was trained to think like an attorney, it was refreshing to be able to appreciate thinking in the way that Tyson suggests. His approach could be of great cultural benefit to us all. At the very least, he is recommending that we work to set aside our insecurities and open up to seeing the world the way he and (according to him) other scientists do. In the process, this could help us open up to one another by questioning our own biases that impede humanistic progress.Of course, this is easier said than done. I am reminded of a quote from John Dewey (Human Nature and Conduct): “Character that is unable to undergo successfully the strain of thought and effort required to bring about competing tendencies into a unity, builds up barriers between different systems of likes and dislikes.  The emotional stress incident to conflict is avoided not by readjustment but by effort at confinement.” This quote resonates with the political divisions and confined tribalism we currently experience in this country. If the reader is looking for a guide as to how to motivate people to emerge from their caves (an analogy he makes in the beginning of the book in support of space travel) and undertake that \"strain of thought and effort\" required for human progress, it will not be found in this book. Perhaps the best we can do is bring scientists to a greater extent, with their perspectives and methods, into our political processes so, at the very least, implicit biases would be challenged before being acted upon. Regardless, I recommend the book. Beyond being informative, it is also an enjoyable read.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['Randall Munroe is the author of the free web comic XKCD. XKCD comics are instantly recognizable by Munroe\\'s surprisingly individual and expressive faceless stick-figure characters. They are less instantly recognizable by their focus on science and mathematics, and by Munroe\\'s ability to write startlingly accurate jokes on these subjects which are actually funny, but also sometimes informative or touching,For a few years now he has also had a blog called \"What If?\" in which he answers questions from users. What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions and What If? 2 are collections of those questions and answers. I started with What If? 2 because I mistakenly ordered it before What If? 1. I do, however, follow Munroe\\'s What If? blog, so it is likely I\\'ve seen most of What If? 1.Just to give you a taste, the first question of What If? 2 is this:\"What would happen if the Solar System was filled with soup out to Jupiter?\"--Amelia, age 5This is a fairly typical type of What If? question. Not all the inquirers are as young as Amelia, but many of them are. The answer in this case begins, \"Please make sure everyone is safely out of the Solar System before you fill it with soup.\". It continues, \"If the Solar System were full of soup out to Jupiter, things might be okay for some people for a few minutes. Then, for the next half hour, things would definitely not be okay for anyone. After that, time would end.\" Munroe goes on to explain in more detail, with pictures, how this all would come about. The full answer is five pages.The subtitle is \"Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions\", and that is indeed the bulk of the book. It contains full answers to 64 such questions -- a typical answer is 3-5 pages. There are also some questions that get less serious answers, five \"Short answers\" chapters, and three \"Weird and Worrying\" chapters. Here\\'s a \"Weird and Worrying\" example,\"Can bees or other animals go to Hell? Or can they murder other bees without consequences?\"Munroe doesn\\'t answer.Here\\'s an example of a question and short answer:\"I was wondering whether there\\'s a way to use my welder as a defibrillator?\"--Lukasz Grabowski\"You should definitely not use your welder as a defibrillator, and after reading your question, I honestly don\\'t think you should be allowed to use it as an arc welder, either.\"Most of the fully answered questions fall into two categories, either \"What would happen if...?\" (obviously the sort of questions envisaged by the title \"What If?\"), and questions that ask for a number, \"How much...?\", \"How many...\", \"How long...?\" The \"What If?\" type questions are the most fun, because they allow Munroe to tell stories. However, the number questions are surprisingly fun, too -- they demonstrate a lot of ingenuity, which one has to admire.Aside from the \"Short Answers\" and \"Weird and Worrying\" questions, what marks What If? 2 is Munroe\\'s commitment to giving real answers -- answers that follow the scenario through to its logical consequences, with careful and well-explained reasoning.And, here\\'s the most important part: It\\'s fun!

Little do we understand the determination and grit it takes to leave everything and everyone behind.  The journey itself is paralyzing both physically and mentally.  I loved this book.  This child had no real idea of what he was about to do, only the memories of his mother spurred him on.  The writing is beautiful in describing the land, the people and the mind of a nine year old boy.  You can feel the desolation, the hot, dryness in your month and the fear when the border patrols are near.  At these times you can’t stop turning pages.  You are so thankful for the couple who took care of this boy.  The realization at the end is the real eye-opener.  None of these people come through unscathed.  This is the part we don’t see on TV.  These immigrants are forever scarred mentally and for this young man to even survive this trek and then have the guts to revisit and write a book is truly amazing.  No one in his family understood what he went through and he didn’t want to remember it.  I know I will never see the youngsters at the border who are trying to get to America and not think about what I learned from this book.',\n",
       "   'I have read many immigrant stories and memoirs; this is among the very best. Written in the form of a novel, this book tells a truth beyond what a novel could imagine. Despite the title, it is very much the story of a makeshift family unit in its struggle to reach \"La USA\". The prose mixes Spanish phrases with the English, giving greater intimacy and authenticity to the story. It reveals the plight of the immigrants from the perspective of a sensitive boy, without extraneous analysis from an omniscient narrator. Having known many Salvadorans who have made some journey like this, it was very valuable to me to hear the story, told by the adult remembering his experience as that child. It was disappointing to see the end of story; we know generally what became of Javier, but we are left to wonder about Patricia, Carla, and Chino.',\n",
       "   'The story is based on a nine-year-old boy’s journey from El Salvador to the U.S. The boy, Javier, travels with coyotes, strangers, and people he knows. He is befriended and betrayed along his journey to join his parents, who have already migrated to the U.S.The character development is good. In addition, the relationship building, and the plot are interesting and heart touching because young  Javier’s vulnerability. The description of the trek allows the reader to visualize the surroundings and obstacles; however, I gave the book four, rather than five stars, because of the redundancy in the detailed desert descriptions. This repetition sometimes bogged down the otherwise wonderfully interesting story.Our book club enjoyed this book.',\n",
       "   \"This is an incredible story!  My daughter is one year younger than Javier.  I cannot imagine sending my child on a trip like this. I am the 5th generation of my family to grow up on our ranch south of Tucson, Arizona.  Javier's descriptions and events throughout the book are very well written and described. I know well the areas he crossed all those times and I could almost see them.  He is very accurate about the borderlands. I am sure he went back as an adult and researched these areas.  How difficult and painful that must have been!  It took great courage to share his story.  Thank you Javiercito for sharing and reminding us of the humanity of migrantes.\",\n",
       "   \"Humanizing those who have been so virulently demonized by political hucksters, xenophobes, and racists is important...and by humanizing, I mean not turning real people into flat characters who fit a faux uplifting narrative.  Solito is beautifully written and deserving of multiple passes for closer attention to both the subject and the brilliantly nuanced use of language (that survives translation) and lyricism which enchants and sharpens the reader's ear/eye.  The perspective of a younger voice is beautifully presented and sustained. The story and its many layers are book club, community-read, and classroom use.  A voice to keep on your radar.  I know I'll read whatever Javier Zamora writes.\",\n",

The narrative flows with surprising ease considering it was supposed to have been written by a nine-year old boy. I too mourn those who have been lost and those who will be lost trying to get to America. These men, women and two children endured heroic trials and survived. We who were born here should reflect on their struggle, for as Horace said, ‘nomine mutato, narratur fabula de te.’',\n",

       "   'This story was very well written and gripping at times. My only issue with it is the level of detail. He was 9 years old and unless he has a photographic memory, the large majority of the story is fiction. I don’t doubt the basic outline of events (coyote, boat ride, bus ride, runs ins with the law, older strangers looking out for him, etc.) but it reads like fiction, not a memoir. He remembers the names of everyone he met on the journey, the things they said, the things he thought, the color of shirts everyone wore, the things the police did, the arrangement of furniture and everything else. More descriptive details than you would normally see in a standard novel. As long as you aren’t a stickler for accuracy or excited by the idea that this is documentation of real events, the story is really well conceived and written.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['It shouldn\\'t be surprising that Quentin Tarantino\\'s film criticism of personally relevant 70s American films is both entertaining and enlightening.  His storytelling skills parse performance, structure, and direction with an emphasis on overall audience delight rather than to illustrate an aesthetic theory of \"cinema.\"I share that same memory of audience participation as child and young teen going to less-than-luxury theaters.  We would trust our developing \"gut\" to recognize and cheer character truths and even hail glorified action (even, or especially, if,  transgressive), as American celluloid mythology itself morphed from the outsider cowboy hero to the moral ambiguity of unpredictable lawmen in an urban wilderness.Who better to survey the films of that fertile era than one of our most extraordinary and inventive directors?My desire to read more Tarantino writing on film is second only to my desire to see more (new) Tarantino films, guaranteed to always unspool to the cathartic delight of us old balcony sitters and grounded groundlings.',\n",
       "   \"Like a lot of famous movie directors, Quentin Tarantino is an absolute movie lover. One thing you learn from this book is that he's been one since he was a little kid. Since then, he's gone on to meet, talk to, and trade stories about thousands of people in the movie industry: actors, producers, directors, stunt men, etc. So he not only knows movies, he knows the stories and personalities behind hundreds and hundreds of films. In fact, reading this book, it's breath-taking to realize how many movies Tarantino has seen (usually more than once) and how much he knows about them.I'm not the biggest fan of Tarantino's movies (although he's truly a great director), but I absolutely loved reading this book. As a result, I wound up watching about ten films, so far, that I'd never even heard of before. The way that Tarantino describes and discusses films is a real work of art. A real treat for any movie buff.\",\n",
       "   \"As a disclaimer I like Tarantino movies, whether he directed or wrote the screenplay. Plus our ages are close and I grew up in LA watching most of the same movies he watched and listed in this book. My folks loved the cinema. His comments are spot on and pretty funny. I'd love to see an entire work dedicated to Spaghetti Westerns, but one can only hope.\",\n",
       "   \"I love Quentin Tarantino's movies and his passion for film history. This book gives wonderful insight into his childhood fascination with movies and how he saw so many adult audience films at such a young age. I enjoyed how he dissected some of his favorite movies and directors. I definitely recommend this book to Tarantino fans.\",\n",
       "   'Reading Cinema Speculation is what I imagine sitting down for a conversation with Tarantino must be like. He gives his unfiltered opinions on dozens of films from his favorite era of film-making and never comes off as pretentious or overly-critical. He writes in his own voice, and if you\\'ve watched any of his interviews on late night TV, you can easily imagine him telling you about these films and going off on the little tangents that inevitably come up. His passion for film-making both as a creator and consumer shines through, but never falls into pure \"fanboy\" territory. Reading this book also comes with the added bonus of watching movies! Whether you\\'ve seen all of the films he discusses, a handful of them, or none of them at all, I\\'m sure you\\'ll be adding a bunch of new films to your watch-list or revisiting some old forgotten favorites.',\n",
       "   \"I enjoyed this book and was blown away by Tarantino's knowledge of films from the late 60's to early 1980's.  In the book, he highlights the movies that influenced him during his formative years and goes into great detail about the screenwriters, directors, actors and production backstories. That said, there's a lot of minutiae that wouldn't keep the interest of a casual reader. It's targeted to people like me who grew up during that period. I would have given it five stars, but sometimes the detail bogs down the reading.\",\n",
       "   'You don’t have to be a Tarantino fan (though I am) to appreciate the author’s intelligent reflections on the art and craft of making movies.  The voice is fluid, relaxed and free of pretensions.  My favorite piece of course is his chapter on Daisy Miller and  my brother, Barry Brown, who took his life at age 27, but all the essays are excellent.  Thank you, Mr. Tarantino, for remembering my brother, and,yes, that “remembering” matters greatly.',\n",

Where I live, you can not drive more than 2 miles without passing a church. This does not bring me confort.Anyone who knows anything about Alabama’s history knows that she has come along way, but her scars run deep, and many of her wounds are still present, infected, and raw. I am great ful for the healing she has undergone over the many decades, but I fear she will always be sick during my lifetime.I feel oppression nearly everyday here, but I do not feel it because I am poor, I do not feel it because I am illiterate, and I certainly do not feel it because of the color of my skin.I wish this book would replace To Kill a Mockingbird as mandatory reading in our public schools. I feel like it’s more relatable, more engaging, and it lingers with you well beyond the closing arguments.The characters in this story are fictional, but the stories are real. The events it discusses happened. Like many things in America’s history, they are shameful, embarrassing, outrageous, disgusting, and heart breaking.The events discussed in the pages of this book are not taught, discussed, or spoken about enough, and they need to be. What are we afraid of? Why are we not having these discussions? This book does not try to gloss over the ugliness or the harm done to the innocent beings, or the harmful impact it has on those it affected.If you belong to a book club that does a historical fiction theme or a black history month, recommend it.

       "  'reviews': ['\"A life lived in simulation is still a life.\"Emily St. John Mandel is an author who has been on my radar for several years. I\\'ve seen glowing reviews of her previous novels The Glass Hotel and Station Eleven, but I\\'ve never gotten around to reading them. Like other much-hyped books, I added them to my TBR list and then ignored them. Her latest novel, Sea of Tranquility, was published earlier this year, and the reviews have been glowing once again. Comparisons to David Mitchell\\'s Cloud Atlas, a novel that both mesmerized and confounded me, piqued my interest even more. I decided it was finally time to read a Mandel novel, and Sea of Tranquility would be a perfect place to begin.What is reality? How do we decipher what is valid from what is imagined? These questions mark the impetus of this novel. It opens in 1912 with Edwin, a young man who has been castigated from his family and his home country in embarrassment. He couldn\\'t keep his mouth shut, and now he finds himself halfway across the world, landing in Western Canada\\'s wilderness. As he wanders the forest, Edwin steps into a place that leaves him questioning his very sanity. \"He steps forward into a flash of darkness, like sudden blindness or an eclipse. He has an impression of being in some vast interior, something like a train station or a cathedral, and there are notes of violin music, there are other people around him, and then an incomprehensible sound—.\"Just as we begin to grapple with the implications of what Edwin experiences, Mandel thrusts us forward a hundred years. We see a composer giving a lecture about his composition that centers around a video recorded by his sister. In the recording, she is seen walking through the forest when time and space seem to blip. Again, before we have time to wrestle with what we read, Mandel moves us forward to the year 2203. We meet a novelist who is on a book tour promoting her latest work. The tour has taken her from her home on a moon colony back to earth. As she laments missing her family, news breaks of a plague beginning to spread on the planet. In a fiction that mirrors Madel\\'s own reality, the author must face promoting her book amongst the spread of a life-threatening illness.It isn\\'t until the mid-point of the novel that things begin to come into focus. We land in the year 2401, to a world (galaxy may be more apt) that is completely transformed. Humanity exists in domed colonies, a reality that is both alien and familiar. Gaspery, a man we\\'ve seen glimpses of in the preceding stories, is fully introduced as a nightwatchman of a hotel, a job he hates. His sister works at a more exciting, but secretive, gig as a scientist who has been investigating anomalies in time and space. She reveals to Gaspery that different centuries and realities are bleeding into each other, an oddity that is without explanation. Gaspery, desperate to shake his dead-end job, agrees to assist her in traveling across time to get to the bottom of this strange aberration.With Sea of Tranquility Emily St. John Mandel takes her readers on a journey across time and space, daring us to ask big questions and to find answers nestled in unlikely places. From a sheer construction standpoint, the novel is a mastery of craft and plotting. Each story corresponds to the next and vice versa creating a nesting doll effect. Yes, other authors have used this device before, but perhaps none to such a rewarding effect. I\\'ll admit to being a bit discombobulated at first. It was hard to see the forest from the trees, especially as Mandel thrust us forward in time with each new section. This confusion is resolved by introducing a character who is able to traverse time, giving us readers someone to help make sense of how everything is connected. Despite the narrative wizardry at play here, Mandel manages to ground her work in characters who glimmer with reality, even when that reality is so different from our own. Ultimately it is the way these characters, love, and lament that makes Sea of Tranquility truly shine.',\n",
       "   'Sea of Tranquility“A simulated life is still a life” (Gaspery, a character in Sea of Tranquility)Sea of TranquilityBy Emily St. John MandelKnopf: 272 pages, $25Emily St. John Mandel is a Canadian writer with a marvelous talent for taking old stories, i.e., pandemics, Ponzi schemes, or time travel, and making them fresh. Sea of Tranquility, Mandel’s new novel, demonstrates this. Mandel is often labeled as an author of speculative fiction, science fiction, and auto-fiction. She can combine many plots and have multiple characters, some of them appearing from novel to novel, and yet she ties the threads together.Here is a sample of her clear but often lyrical prose:“What it was like to leave Earth: a rapid ascent over the green-and-blue world, then the world was blotted out all at once by clouds. The atmosphere turned thin and blue, the blue shaded into indigo, and then — it was like slipping through the skin of a bubble — there was black space.” A single surreal incident is the core event of Sea of Tranquility.In 1912, an 18-year-old Englishman named Edwin St. John St. Andrew, disillusioned with the British Empire, meets a mysterious stranger and then walks into a Canadian forest. Underneath a giant maple tree, he suddenly feels he is in some vast interior, like a train station or a cathedral. There are notes of violin music. Edwin is terrified by a combination of unearthly sounds. Is he going mad? In 1994, a young woman named Vincent is filming the same tree and sky and hears violin music and unexplained sounds. The same stranger is lurking in the forest.Is time, itself, unraveling with one event bleeding into other time periods? Are there parallel worlds in everyone’s personal story?At a party, years later, Vincent meets a visitor who reveals her spouse is running a Ponzi scheme and that she and her friends will be ruined in a few months. In another scene, a writer named Olive Llewellyn—not unlike Mandel—is warned by the same mysterious visitor to cancel her book tour because something deadly (a pandemic) will soon happen.The mystery man is a time traveler detective named Gaspery-Jacques Roberts living on the moon in the 25th century in a colony called the Night City. He works for a sinister organization called the Time Institute. Gaspery’s assignment is to travel back into the past and discover why separate incidents from different centuries are rupturing and overlapping into each other.Here is where Mandel gets complex with stories within stories.Mandel’s fictional character, novelist Olive Llewellyn, has an individual named Gaspery in her bestseller Marienbad, which was released in the 23rd century. Marienbad is a dystopian novel she wrote on the brink of an actual pandemic. Ironically, this parallels Mandel herself whose huge hit, Stations Eleven—about a pandemic—was published before the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. When it did, Mandel resented being called a prophet.Eventually, Gaspery travels back in time to visit Edwin, now a disabled veteran from World War I, and explains to him what his 1912 encounter means. Edwin recognizes Gaspery as the weird stranger from his past. If Edwin is suffering from the war, at least the forest vision was not a hallucination caused by mental illness. This action marks Gaspery as an outlaw and eventual fugitive because he has violated a Time Institute rule of never revealing his purpose.Critics have high praise for Sea of Tranquility. Maureen Corrigan of NPR had this to say: “Sea of Tranquility is a poignant, ingeniously constructed and deeply absorbing novel that surveys big questions about the cruel inevitability of time passing, loss, the nature of what we consider reality and, in the end, what finally matters.”Here is Laird Hunt: “Following a superb stylist like Mandel is like watching an expert lacemaker at work: You see the strands and later the beautiful results, but your eyes simply cannot follow what comes in between. As in her best work, including Station Eleven, she is less concerned with endings than with continuity.”Sea of Tranquility ends with an extraordinary reveal.If Emily St. John Mandel’s world is always ending, there remains a sense that Mandel’s very human characters, living and dead, will return to haunt the readers.',\n",

While I enjoyed that book, it was a much more straightforward story. The ending was nice and the story was enjoyable, but it wasn't quite as enthralling as Sea of Tranquility. In the beginning, I thought Edwin St. Andrew was going to be the Arthur of this story and I was going to learn a lot about his life. I was fully ready for a simple and interesting story about Edwin. By the third chapter I was fascinated by the character and would have enjoyed reading about his life. What I got was so much more than I expected.Everyone should read this book\",\n",

I feel like they were every closer in this book then the other two. I really wish I had and Ana or a Maya!Bobo is such a fun character and I love the stupid stuff he says! Freezers are time machines! 😂I would definitely recommend reading the Trigger warnings on this one because it is full of them 🙈The ending was so wrapped up I didn’t think he was going to do that. I think i secretly was hoping for another book but it was just everything I could of hoped for in a ending. Thank you Backman for giving it to us.When Zackell let Alicia wear his numbers it was just so magical💔😭This was definitely my favorite of the series and Benji ovich has my heart forever 💔The end! 😂🙈',\n",
       "   'Fans of the BEARTOWN trilogy were looking forward to seeing what happened to Benji, Maya, Peter and Kira Anderson, Ana, Maya’s best friend and Amat.What we got were even more characters and a rather choppy read. When on stage, none of them got to go any kind of distance without being interrupted. This being said, the book had its moments, especially when Ana was featured. There’s a terrible wind storm in the forest; a man and his pregnant wife are trying to make it to the hospital when they’re stymied by fallen trees. A new character, Hannah, a midwife, is called upon to rescue the mother and the baby. The only way for her to get there is for Ana to drive her. Ana knows the forest better than anybody except for her father who’s too drunk to drive. As Hannah says, Ana is the type of person who runs toward the fire. Another touching moment happens toward the end of the book when Ana gives Hannah a mother’s day card. Ana never had a mother, but she made mother’s day cards with her fellow students, and she gives one to Hannah as thanks for being the mother she never had.The climax of the story is another rape, and once again the girl, Ruth, isn’t believed.  She leaves the forest only to die of a drug overdose, but her brother Matteo never forgets what happened to her and the boy who did it. He wants revenge.Readers will remember the little girl Sune, the A-team coach, was teaching to play hockey. Alicia forms a relationship with Benji, one of the mainstays from the first two books, when Sune’s dog is poisoned. They go to the hockey arena and he teaches her how to deal with stress. She will go on to be a national team super star. Benji and Alicia become implicated in the climax when Matteo seeks revenge.There is another sub plot dealing with an editor in chief on the Hed newspaper who discovers all kinds of shady goings on the hockey team that implicate Peter Anderson. Tails, the owner of the supermarket, is the real culprit there. Backman is a master of bringing so-called villains back from the depths. Tails proves he has a conscience, and a character named Lev whom we meet in connection with Amat’s attempt to get drafted into the NHL also proves to be misunderstood. Lev tries to make money by charging the various clubs for an interview with Amat. Amat isn’t drafted. Later Lev, who owns a junkyard near Hed, tries to stop Matteo when he finds out he has a gun.Backman also has a penchant for foreshadowing. For instance we know who’s going to get killed during the Matteo climax. Rather than provide an epilogue to give us info on what happens to the major characters and some of the minor ones, Backman intrudes on the ending and simply tells us. This will be the last Beartown novel, and he tries to fill in all the gaps, but a few characters, like Big City, just disappear.',\n",
       "   'I’m not a hockey fan (or any sports, for that matter!) & had reservations reading the first book in this series ‘Beartown’ that came highly recommended by a friend. But I’m glad I did as this series was amongst the best books I’ve read in decades & I’m an avid reader!  Touching, heartfelt, & deep, amazing characters that you care about, root for & immediately become immersed in their lives. It’s not only about hockey but people & relationships in a small, forest town in Northern Sweden. The foreign setting makes it all that much more interesting as it’s not a way of life we’re much familiar with. The series is ‘Beartown’, ‘Us Against You’ & this book ‘The Winners’ concludes the trilogy. Highly recommend starting at the beginning & reading all three!',\n",

I have a love/ hate relationship with this author.  His deceptively simple language packs a wallop, and he hits his readers upside the head repeatedly.  I love how he shows us the best and worst of our humanity by telling a complicated, simple story.  I love how the heroes show their faults.  I love how the \"hooligans\" are heroes.  I love how the most unlikely become successful, and how the successful fall.  I love how the words make me laugh out loud.  I hate how he telegraphs the horrors to come and drags us kicking and screaming to the event itself.  I hate how he makes us love the characters so much we are bereft when they die.  I love how well he writes about love, hope, and salvation.  This is an unforgettable journey through the forest and should not be missed.',\n",

It should be mandatory reading for all of us. John Boyle is a very gifted writer and I know I’ll continue reading anything he creates.

What if your father was the commandant of the most notorious extermination camp in Germany. This is 91 year-old Gretel Fernsby's history. Of course, she didn't know. How could she? And even if she did, what could she possibly do. She was only 12 years-old.

But a character who does evil, as well as good,  a person who makes the reader squirm a bit as they decide which path they’d take when presented with ethical choices, that’s the kind of figure I prefer at the center of my novels.Gretel Wilson, or whichever surname she’s using these days, is that kind of character.  Contemporaneously, she’s an adorable 91 year old Londoner who still enjoys strolling through Hyde Park and gossiping with the neighbor across the hallway. But she has a dark past - the daughter of a Nazi commandant who ran a concentration camp - that’s she kept hidden for eight decades.  And that’s about all I want to say about this novel because if you choose to read it, I want it to unfold as perfectly for you as it did for me - one incredible storyline after the other.This isn’t a perfect book.  At times some of the plot twists are a bit too fantastical for my tastes. But it was a novel that I couldn’t put down, that I needed to finish just to find out how Gretel’s story ends, and by my definition, that makes for an awesome read.  As John Boyne writes in his afterward , “it is a novel about guilt, complicity, and grief,” and if you’ve lived a long enough and interesting enough life, you’ve dealt with all of those emotions at some point.  This book will help you examine them even further.',\n",

       "  'reviews': ['In \"The Maid,\" by Nita Prose, the main character is Molly, a maid at the Regency Grand Hotel.  In the beginning of the book, I was immediately amazed at how author Nita Prose had the gift of describing the hotel in such a way that I could see its every detail and also her ability to relay each aspect of Molly\\'s repetitive job as to make it sound fascinating, because that is the way that Molly saw it.  It took me a while to catch onto the fact that trusting, reliable Molly was somewhere on the autism spectrum and definitely suffered from OCD. She was abandoned by her parents and raised by her beloved grandmother, who had recently passed away.  Unfortunately, because of Molly\\'s trusting nature, she became easy prey for unscrupulous people.  For example, a past \"boyfriend\" has managed to steal all of the money that Molly\\'s grandmother had saved for Molly\\'s subsistence after her death. She cannot even pay her rent on time. Similarly, at work, some people that Molly trusts are setting her up for quite a fall in a case involving drug trafficking and murder. The doorman at the hotel and his daughter lawyer come to her defense, but the book is quite a whodunnit that the author likens to the old board game, \"Clue.\" Molly thinks in cliches that she was taught by her grandmother, and her lack of social skills makes people misinterpret her reactions to significant events. A potential drawback for some readers is Molly\\'s perpetual repetition of the cliches by which she lives.  She is subject to ridicule, and people make fun of her behind her back.  Although she turns out to be quite the heroine, a few reveals in the later chapters had me truly surprised.  The book is simultaneously funny, poignant, and suspenseful. The book is accompanied by questions that a book club could use for discussion.',\n",
       "   'Five Big Stars for this debut novel and heartwarming thriller with an enormous amount of whit! I loved this story from the very first page. Our heroine, Molly, is a good and kind soul to her core. The two things she loves more than anything are her gran and her job as a maid. She strives at being the best employee she can possibly be, as her life revolves around structure and perfection for the people she serves. Molly has her struggles and knows she’s different. She lacks in social skills, is extremely awkward, and is most likely on the autism spectrum. Molly’s vulnerability and naivete draws her to people who she believes are good and true, and this ultimately leads her to becoming a suspect in a hotel murder. Trust me, this whole time you’ll be shaking your head while reading and might, possibly, want to throw the book across the room, as the police get it all wrong. This is such a well written and original novel. A rare find. You’ll have no choice but to cheer and route for the heroine because she’s just so pure and earnest.',\n",
       "   'The Maid is a wonderful character study that had me cheering on twenty-five-year-old hotel maid Molly Gray almost from the very first page. Daughter of a \"fly by night\" father and a drug addict mother, Molly was raised by her loving grandmother, herself a maid in a wealthy household. Upset whenever her chosen routine is ignored by others, Molly clings to the simple rules her grandmother gave her to navigate through a world she feels like an outsider in-- no matter how much she wants to belong.Molly\\'s special blend of observation and naivete easily gets her into trouble, and several times I found myself mentally trying to steer her away from the people she\\'s placing her trust in as well as trying to steer her toward the people she should trust. Unfortunately, my mental powers aren\\'t very good and she seldom paid attention to me-- which means that The Maid is a much better book as a result.One of the best things about this book is the fact that, as I read, I became uncertain about Molly. Is she telling me everything? Can I trust her? My indecision made me read more carefully. Even though I only saw all the other characters through Molly\\'s eyes, each one was vivid in my mind\\'s eye, a testament to the author\\'s skill. And, although this is a mystery, it\\'s as a character study that The Maid shines brightly. I am so glad I met Molly and got to see the world through her eyes.',\n",

       "  'reviews': ['A book that was impossible to put down. Another Holocaust story? Perhaps. However, this one resonates on many levels, especially Vrba\\'s eye for detail, his youthful rebelliousness, his independent spirit in the face of the overwhelming odds., combined with his practical nature. Despite the the randomness of live and death under those conditions, these traits helped him survive as well as prosper after the war. He was a victim who refused to be a victim.At first, it\\'s difficult to believe that anyone could recall such events in such elaborate detail. However, Vrba\\'s ability to memorize a science textbook while in his teens, plus his chosen profession after the war as a biochemist,  point to the ability to remember prodigious details and recall them as well as draw logical conclusions.The lessons of the Holocaust or the Holodomor or any genocide and mass murder event, is that they are NOT unique. Yes, the Holocaust was different in how it was carried out since the National Socialists used all the tools and technology available to a modern technologically advanced nation- state, but not that it happened. The Holodomor in Ukraine happened in the decade prior to the Holocaust, and was perpetrated by a different set of socialists, using cruder methods of repression and starvation.Human nature has not changed, and human civilization goes in cycles. Vrba\\'s observations of how some European Jews arriving at Auschwitz thought they were being resettled when they arrived on the Judenrampe is perhaps the most telling. The Germans were the most \"civilized, educated and cultured\" Europeans and the real fate of these folks was as inconceivable to those arrivals, as it was to most of those that read the Vrba-Wetzler Report.To some folks today-ironically in Western nations- the truth of the Holocaust is so horrible as to be unbelievable. Given that even if one discounts the testimony from eyewitnesses like Vrba, the physical evidence is overwhelming. The Nazis kept great records too.Sadly, it may not matter in the future. If post World War II history is any guide, the human species has not learned much if anything and it is likely that genocide and mass murder are not just aberrations of the past.',\n",
       "   'Jonathan Freedland\\'s book, \"The Escape Artist,\" presents the story of Walter Rosenberg (who later changed his name to Rudolf Vrba), a teenaged Slovakian Jewish lad, who suffered the indignities inflicted by the Nazi governments that took over Hitler\\'s annexed areas.  At first, Jews lost their right to education, to own property, to move about freely, and were forced to wear Yellow Stars.  Then in February of 1942, Walter received notice that all Jews aged 16 to 30 were being \"resettled\" in Poland. He tried to flee to England but was caught and assigned to a labor camp. When he escaped that camp and was caught again, he was sent to a higher security facility, the infamous Auschwitz.A great deal of the book is devoted to describing the labor assignments of men and women who were deemed fit enough to work as slaves.  Although it was not an immediate realization, Walter eventually figured out that 90 percent of the Jews who departed the cattle cars that brought them to the camp were immediately killed, as soon as they could walk to the gas chambers (that were represented to them as showers).  The other 10 percent were kept as slaves until death. Once Walter assessed the true purpose of the camp, he was motivated by one overwhelming desire. If only he could escape and warn the world that concentration camps were extermination camps rather than areas of resettlement, people would stop getting on the trains and walking peacefully to their deaths. Walter shrewdly learned how to gain access to the most desirable work details. When he was a sorter of the goods that the killed Jews had brought with them to camp, he could pocket some valuable materials to trade for extra food and the leverage he would gain as potential blackmail material against the SS who accepted such goods from him. I had never read such details regarding the work assignments at the concentration camps.  Major corporations still in business today benefited greatly from the slave labor that built industrial complexes near the camps. At the age of 19, Walter and a companion did what no one had never done before - they actually escaped from Auschwitz after memorizing the exact protocols for searching for missing prisoners and waiting them out while hiding underneath the ground.After a treacherous journey, Walter achieved his dream.  He began warning the Jews in Hungary that they were the next to be shipped to the extermination camp. Unbelievably, despite the extraordinary details that Walter had memorized, his warnings were not passed on by Jewish leaders.  Even the Allies, including America and Britain, were not moved to action by Walter\\'s written reports.  Each reader will need to decide for himself if this was because Walter\\'s story was deemed too outlandish to be believed or if there were other various unacceptable reasons for not intervening.  Walter\\'s proposed solution was not to bomb the camp itself, which would kill innocents along with the guilty, but to bomb the railroad tracks that led to the camp, which would prevent the continuing transport of Jews to their deaths. Eventually some journalists in Switzerland and other countries began to print parts of Walter\\'s report, but not until at least 600,000 more Jews were gassed to death.The book follows the rest of Walter\\'s life after the war ended.  Disillusioned and suffering from PTSD, he had trouble finding fulfilment in life or in his personal relationships.  He did become an expert witness in many trials regarding war crimes. Although the subject matter of Freedland\\'s book is outright appalling and very depressing, I recommend it because of the light it shines on some of the lesser-known horrors of the holocaust.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"It's so hard for me to find contemporary romances I actually enjoy because so many of them end up feeling really bland to me because they lack emotional stakes and conflict. I need some kind of driving force involving external conflict or inner turmoil to keep me turning pages, and that seems to be something that more and more authors are afraid to include these days. Maybe that's because, these days, any semi-flawed or unlikable character or situation involving any kind of nuance ends up getting you cancelled on TikTok.PART OF YOUR WORLD, however, is that one book in one hundred that actually manages to write a successful rom-com that doesn't feel patronizing, unrealistic, or-- worse-- pandering. It includes so many of my favorite tropes that it felt like it was written for me: small town vibes, reverse age gap, class differences, STEM heroine (she's a doctor!), cute animals, strong female friendships, and loads and loads of family d(tr)auma to unpack and dread and scream over.Alexis meets Daniel when her car gets stuck in a ditch. He helps tow her and then they meet again when she stops at the local bar for a bite. They end up hitting it off but she's a little put off by how young he is, and how their lives are totally different. (Read: she's loaded.) But they end up deciding to be a sort of exclusive-friends-with-benefits thing, which I wouldn't have minded if ALL THE SEX SCENES WEREN'T FADE TO BLACK (rude), but obviously they both catch feelings and obviously, both of them have extenuating factors that come into conflict with their budding romance. Daniel is about to lose his family house because his drug-addicted mother owns it and she wants to sell it all to run off with some guy. And Alexis is being put under incredible pressure by her manipulative and uptight family and her emotionally abusive ex.The conflict drives the story and keeps up the tension, adding edge to what would otherwise be a pretty sugary-sweet insta-love romance wish fulfillment fantasy. Not that there's anything wrong with that. While I was composing my review in my head, I was actually going to talk about how *some* fluffy books manage to sell that fantasy without being too annoying. But then all that other stuff in the book came into play and I ended up being even more impressed than I already was. I only really have three complaints: (1) if you're going to tell me this dude is the Alexander the Great of having sex, you have to give us SOMETHING. Otherwise it feels like a taunt. (2) It kind of felt like the whole thing with Daniel's mom was just kind of resolved off-page, which was weird, because it felt like the book was playing her up to do something awful. (3) Could have done with 90% fewer Princess Bride references.But overall, this was a lovely book. Just as good as the last book by this author that I read and thank goodness I have two more of hers on Kindle to read. PLUS, the next book in this series is going to be about Bri and she is absolutely the coolest and I can't wait for her story.Thanks to FLINN and Anniek for reading this with me! Make sure to check out their reviews! :)4 out of 5 stars\",\n",

She decides to stop at the local bar for a quick bite to eat before she heads off home again.Daniel Grant was the guy who stopped to help her, he and his ancestors are a part of the fabric of this small town. He runs his family B&B and is a very talented carpenter. He is also the town Mayor, which is not as arduous as it sounds with a population of 350 people for most of the year.Alexis being in the local bar raises lots of interest for all the single guys. They’ve either grown up with, know of or have dated every woman in town so Alexis is fair game as far as they are concerned. Daniel swoops in and saves her from them all with his witty banter and general warmth.Alexis has recently gone through a break up. After lots of therapy she has come out much stronger and more aware of what she wants/deserves in a future partner. One thing she does now is that she is not interested in dating or relationships. This is how she ends up spending the night in Daniel’s bed. Let me put some context around this…‘Daniel somehow managed to be charming and completely down-to-earth while also exuding pure sex. It was the most baffling combination. And one I wasn’t capable of refusing.’Daniel truly is a genuinely lovely guy and Alexis probably can’t explain it herself but there is a connection there. A pull towards each other that even after a few hours of conversation over a grilled cheese sandwich they find themselves naked together. Alexis knows she will never return and she really needs a night like this. Daniel does not disappoint, he is attentive, intuitive and gives her a night she will never forget.After Alexis leaves, Daniel is left wondering if it was all just a beautiful dream. This gorgeous, intelligent and articulate woman - who he thinks is waaay out of his league has left her mark on him. He cannot stop thinking of her and he will do anything to spend more time with her. And then she calls him..Alexis’ path in life was carved out for her before she was born. Her family has generations of surgeons that have come before her but she defied the norm a little by becoming an ER doctor. Not a career deemed as anything of significance to her father. She constantly fails to meet the high expectations set by him and her recent break up with a surgeon he considered a son to him has not helped. Now she is the sole Montgomery doctor left at the hospital and he expects her to step up.As you can see, Alexis’ world and Daniel’s are so far removed from each other but despite all of this she finds herself driving to see him most weekends. They are developing feelings for each other, big, huge, deep feelings that can never be any more than that. His life is in Wakan, and hers in Minneapolis - both anchored by the generations that came before them.‘This relationship would never expand. It would never take a deep breath and pull in those around us. It wouldn’t fill its lungs with my people and my life. It would just be this.  Only this.’Honestly, my heart was breaking for this couple. Alexis has one true best friend, Bri (you are going to love her) and other than that no one else is in her cheer team, apart from Daniel. He makes her feel seen, he believes in her, he cares so much for her and put simply, all he wants is Alexis. She is so torn up over what she feels for Daniel, she is being pulled in so many directions and is drowning in the weight of expectations thrown upon her.‘Nothing could convince me this woman wasn’t made for me to love.  I think my soul recognized hers the second I laid eyes on her. Our bodies knew it the very first night.  The power she had over me terrified me. But it also gave me clarity.’Okay, so with all of this heavy angst there are also equal amounts of fun, laughter and swoon :) There is Chloe the goat, Kevin Bacon the pig, Hunter the dog and all the wonderful townsfolk of Wakan. The banter between Alexis and Daniel was so adorable and I laughed so much. I really hope we get more stories from the wonderful secondary characters in this story.Well this was my reading highlight of the month, all those wonderful book feels that I love were here in abundance, I never wanted this to end!‘I love you’ he whispered. ‘We are together. This isn’t over. And even if you leave, it won’t be over because you’ll take the love with you and it’ll bring you back.’']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['This excellent book explains what it means to be a visual thinker, how our culture and schools are biased against visual thinkers, the detrimental effect of that bias on individuals, why our society needs visual thinkers, the benefits of visual and verbal thinkers working together, and the relevance of visual thinking to the issue of animal consciousness.  As such, this is a very important book that deserves to be widely read.I would have given this book 4.8 stars, had the rating system allowed it.  My rating of 4 stars does not take away from how interesting and important this book is.Comments that might lead to improvements:1. The quality of the writing might have improved had the book been written as a full collaboration with a verbal thinker.  Although the book is broadly well organized into 7 sections, readers who think sequentially will sometimes find the organization less than ideal. As an example, the author says that an animal recognizing itself in a mirror is viewed by many scientists as“…the gold standard for the highest level of animal consciousness: self-awareness.  If you have a dog, you’ve probably noticed that upon seeing its reflection, it will either bark or not react at all, and never get past this stage” (p.258).Now, an experience in my own life contradicts this conclusion about consciousness.  On one ordinary day, our dog Meg was chasing a rabbit up our long driveway. The rabbit circled back clockwise and ran right in front of Meg.  But Meg was hot on the rabbit’s scent trail.  Instead of following the rabbit, she took the same clockwise loop in her pursuit.  (She did not catch the rabbit.)Because of this observation, I don’t take the mirror test as saying much about dog consciousness.  It is not until page 266 that the author writes“The reason dogs do not engage with their image in the mirror is likely because their primary senses for socializing are smell and hearing, with vision a distant third.”Placing all these sentences in one paragraph (on p.258, with the reference to scientists’ “gold standard”), along with other evidence of dog consciousness, would improve the reader’s experience.2. Throughout the book, Dr. Grandin often repeats the same concepts and stories, such as the observations she made when visiting cattle chutes.3. Each chapter opens with drawings of cattle handling facilities, presumably drawn by the author.  As you may know, she has worked extensively for slaughter houses, and, if you love animals, you would want to know at the very beginning of the book how she reconciles this life choice while claiming to be an animal lover herself.  She provides a reasonable, intelligent answer, but you won’t find it until page 272.4. Temple Grandin is both a visual thinker and autistic.  As a child and young adult, she was treated unkindly, unfairly, and sometimes abusively because of the ways she processed information.  I am therefore somewhat sympathetic when I read what I see as incomplete, biased, or inaccurate descriptions of some of the individuals she uses as examples.  For example, she referred to Thomas Edison as the inventor of over one thousand devices.  Biographies and the description in Wikipedia say that“Edison was legally credited with most of the inventions produced there [Menlo Park], though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.”Dr. Grandin seems enamored of Elon Musk.  She omits the fact that Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning actually founded Tesla, Incorporated.  Musk is a successful businessman and showman, but he is not an inventor.5. The book focuses primarily on two kinds of visual thinking and contrasts it to verbal thinking.  However, a more complete description of other modes of thinking would have enriched the book and better engaged readers.  For example, my step-mother had an extraordinary auditory memory.  This ability enabled her to vividly and precisely recall the words she heard spoken.  She said it was almost like a recording, along with a memory of where and when she heard those words.  The same thing applied to song melodies and lyrics.6. Another example that Grandin omits is people who “think” kinesthetically.  Those are the people who become dancers, Olympic wrestlers, and gymnasts.7. I have no doubt that computer programming is an area where Temple Grandin’s Spatial Visual thinkers excel (p.178).  What she does not reveal is that even for relatively simple programming tasks, the algorithms that each computer programmer creates is usually a unique solution.  Analysis of each algorithm is needed in order to discover precisely how each programmer’s mind is unique.It’s likely that individuals think and experience the world in many ways, each of which is on a continuum.  Many of these differences remain hidden.  Dividing people simply into the book’s categories of verbal, object visual, and spatial visual, is overly simplistic.  However, Temple Grandin’s Visual Thinking calls attention to some of the ways different people think.  Hopefully, by doing so, more people will value these differences.',\n",
       "   \"I liked the movie about her, and I thought it was very interesting when she was talking about her hugging box. I have autism myself, but I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my 30s, so that a lot of my behavior when I was a child was very mysterious to me, & it was certainly very mysterious to my parents, and one of the things that I liked to do very much was squeeze into tight spaces, often in closets, and when I heard Temple talk about her squeeze box and how this allowed her to be hugged without physical contact, was like being hit on the head with a sledgehammer !!!This book starts off seemingly as an apology for the ill behavior inflicted upon autistic people and perhaps those neurotypicals with special abilities, by the mainstream educational system which has seemingly betrayed them !!!She goes on and on about how these children are an elemental necessity to the survival of humanity, but I was thinking that all of these jobs that she was insisting our being held vacant by this prejudice against the autistic spectrum are actually being filled by reasonably competent people, so that this claim of hers may not have to weight that she think it does ( ? )One odd thing is that she and many others that may be characterized as neurodivergent have often talked about how they're bullied as children, and I've often thought that it's extremely odd that I never experienced anything like that at all !!! In fact I have rationalized it as the politeness of Bullies, or as some kind of code that they must adhere to ??? And it would work like this; I suppose many people think that the weekend defenseless are the first victims of bullies, but it was my experience that they perceived that I was too fragile for their attentions and so they left me alone, or it may have been-- and this is probably the more realistic solution, is that I just happened to go to a grade school that had very few, if any bullies...?Then after that; the second half of the book just goes off into a lot of different directions and not really sure what she was trying to get at, just a lot of how the brain and emotions work and she would often cite cases where her special ability to think visually allowed her to see solutions to problems that ordinary people... ( which I personally like to call The Damp Masses or possibly Muggles ! ( I've been told that both of these however are considered very derogatory and I'm not supposed to do that ! ) ) ... Are unable to do, essentially this visual thinking ability is like a superpower, but her claims often seem severely untested ???All in all; a nice enough book.\",\n",

Retiring assassins, four women of a certain age, have spent their lives bringing justice to Nazis and other evil doers and they look forward to relaxing in their retirement years.. Celebrating on a cruise it becomes apparent that they are being targeted for assassination themselves and they must use all the skills they've garnered to find their potential killers!  The character development is excellent, the plot and settings are exciting and Deanna's use of wit cuts through the suspense and made me laugh out loud sometimes.  READ THIS BOOK! You will thank me!\",\n",
       "   \"I am a female approaching a certain age and when I read the part of this where Billie identifies a modern male wet worker by his backside, I knew these women were my people.  This book was delightfully written with rich descriptions that make it ripe for adaptation to a movie or show.  The pacing is solid with solid progression and development of the plot.The four main women are vibrant in their detail and I love them all.  I do have a definite affinity for Billie, who is the main character, and got me with her desire to never marry or have kids.  Mary Alice is also a kindred spirit with her wife Akiko, Kevin, their hellion cat that hates to travel and her choice of gay regency romance novels to read while on a cruise.  The way all the women in this were portrayed as well as their interpersonal dynamics was just so refreshing and sadly unusual in what I typically read.Mostly just because of the title, I picked this from the list of qualifying titles to get the Best of 2022 achievement unlocked for a Kindle Challenge and I am so glad that I did.  I'm frugal so I very rarely intentionally buy a ebook that costs more than $10, but I did with this one and I added the Audible narration and I have zero regrets.  I consumed this in just a few hours.  If you identify as female and have rage, I cannot recommend this title highly enough.  It absolutely belongs on a Best of 2022 list.\",\n",
       "   'I liked reading a book about characters that feel their age but still get things done. These women all had full dynamic life with a complicated sort of a side job. They’re friendship has stayed true so getting to retire together should be a celebration but their relaxing cruise turns into a mess. I liked that these women were able to use the misogyny and ageism to their advantage as they used their assassin skills to protect themselves and their friends.Everything was so neat and things mostly just fell perfectly into place but this is not a non-fiction how to book, so if you buy into the fun of a story of empowerment about a group of friends then it’s just exciting fun. Do you guess the twist? Sure there are only so many options and you don’t see all the turns in that twist.Also great, the end is about the women. No one is saved by or falls into the arms of even the most wonderful men in the story. They determined the end and what happens next. It’s just nice. True to the story.',\n",

As the bodies start to pile up, the Killers of a Certain Age use the misogyny and ageism of their former colleagues to their advantage as they bring this tale to a satisfying conclusion.This is entirely different anything Deanna Rayburn has published before, and I enjoyed it tremendously.',\n",
       "   'Humorous at times and deadly serious at others. Fascinating character study and a plot that is well paced but not fast. Enjoyed reading details of planned hits as well as the interaction between the characters.',\n",

       "   \"I've read my fair share of spy thrillers and detective mystery novels, and 'Killers of a Certain Age' once one of the fastest books I've ever read. I really enjoyed the texture that jumping back and forth in time provided for the character development and justification for those characters actions. I think the only thing I would have appreciated more of was more information on the four central character's live before they were recruited by The Museum. Despite that, this was a very enjoyable read and once you find your groove and start melding with the four main characters, you get a knack for their quips and quirks. I definitely would recommend this to any avid readers out there.\",\n",
       "   '( no spoilers ahead) This is my first book by Deanna Raybourn, and now I can’t wait to read the rest! From the very first page, the characters, story and writing style grabbed me, making it really hard to stop.  I confess to some nights of closing my Kindle app at 3 AM with alarm pre-set for 6 on a “school night “. The story moves forward at a non-stop pace, from meeting the protagonist to the very end.  Just imagine an excellent rollercoaster ride, blindfolded, not knowing what will happen next: a swing around a curve, steep uphill climb, or sudden swooping, exhilarating drop.  Ms. Raybourn skillfully crafted the characters and plot, without a wasted paragraph, unnecessary description or gratuitous man bashing by her all-star female  cast of characters.I’m so glad I bumped into this book and clicked “send a sample”.

       "   'One beautiful woman walks out of the water (sentence number one) and sets a city on fire. Danny Ryan is watching the woman in the black bikini. At first, he thinks she might be a vision.Don Winslow (sentence number two) in control:“Except she’s real and she’s going to be trouble.”Gather around, my friends, let me tell you a tale of mobs in Rhode Island in the 1980’s.Gut punch. Cross. Double-cross. Loyalty. Disloyalty. Rackets and mobs.Bloody, brutal—bang. You give yourself over easily. We’re in such sure hands. Nothing flashy. The plot has plenty of pizzaz and more than a few characters. But don’t forget—Winslow knows. He keeps it airy, open.With Danny, we’re in the world of waterfront workers. Dogtown. Upper South Providence. We’re among Irish Americans. Life is hard. Danny thinks about going back to fishing. He thinks about getting out altogether. Maybe California? Staying means trouble. He knows it. But his wife is too embedded in Dogtown. There’s too much family around. Too many obligations. Too many routines.At the outset of City on Fire, there’s a truce in effect. Things are so calm that Danny even picks up a little work working for the rivals. Danny has played the heavy, the collector. He likes to be respectful. Occasionally, he has to rough up a debtor. “He isn’t a leg-breaker, though. That stuff rarely happens anyway—a man with a broken stick can’t work and a man who can’t work can’t make any kind of payments at all out on the vig, never mind the principal. So Danny might hurt them, but he doesn’t hurt them bad.” Relative scales of morality. Danny has a heart.Things are about to change. Danny’s wife is Terri and her brother is a buffoon named Liam. Liam grabs a woman. It’s an insult. Retaliation is in order. If it takes this infraction to ignite the war, then anything could have started the new round of brutalities. There are murders. And savage counterattacks. Racism runs rampant. Homophobia, too. Misogyny, check.And we keep our eye on Danny, who gets badly hurt. “But you can’t live in fear, Danny thinks. You take reasonable precautions, you check your rearview mirror, you keep your gun close to hand and your head on a swivel and you live your life.” Still, Danny watches a fishing boat and wishes he was on it, “wishes his life were as clean and sharp as the water, that if he jumped in, the cold and the salt and the surf would strip his skin of the film that always seems to be on it these days.”But Danny can’t leave. He’s got a wife and, as the book goes along, a kid. And he’s got Dogtown. And his father. And they’re all relying on him in one way or another.As City on Fire makes clear, mobs aren’t free-floating things. They are interconnected in the lives of average-appearing families. That may not be news in the history of mob novels and mob movies, but this story is a clear reminder that rackets are right here (and sometimes operating in plain sight, as the news makes clear every day). Rackets—a tradition unlike any other.The story is a modern-day echo of Homer’s Iliad (quoted as new sections start). And Virgil’s Aeneid. (On this point, I only know what I read.) There is an epic flavor to the whole novel, as if it’s the latest episode in a battle back across the millennia.City on Fire wraps with a tangle of violent crosses and tricky subterfuges. Lots has happened to Danny and his family. Danny’s got a lot to think about. There are still choices ahead, family and a future to think out, but Danny has no idea where he’ll go. Or if.City on Fire is unforgettable. And it’s only a few weeks (April 2023) until book number two comes out—City of Dreams.I’m going out on a limb, but my hunch is that the word “dreams” might be in the ironic sense.',\n",

I just couldnt care less. We have all read and heard this so often. Winslow tries hard to make the women appear cleverer than the neanderthal men in the story..but like in his other novels, women are always just beautiful and cleverer only in the sense that they barter their sexual services in a self-rewarding way... I wont be reading the follow up novel to this story.\"]},\n",

       "   'The Overnight Guest is my first read by Heather Gudenkauf. The eerie cover and the synopsis drew me in and I am so glad it did because I was hooked from beginning to end.Wylie Lark is a true crime writer who is staying in an isolated farmhouse in a small town in Iowa to finish her latest book. Her book is about the people that were murdered twenty years ago in that very same farmhouse and the young girl that disappeared without a trace. With a snow and ice storm hammering down, Wylie finds herself trapped in the house haunted by its secrets as well as her own. When Wylie finds a child lying in the snow in the yard, she brings him into the house for warmth and safety, but Wylie soon learns that with this child comes danger.This book is told in a dual timeline. The timeline in the present centers around Wylie. I loved the eeriness this timeline brought to the book. Gudenkauf’s writing of the snow and ice storm actually made me cold and I could just visualize everything I was reading. We get a little back story on Wylie in this timeline, she is divorced and is estranged from her teenage son. She comes across as a bit cold to start but I did grow to like her by the end of the book. When she first brings the child into the house, she gets very agitated when he shied away from her and wouldn’t talk. But when push came to shove, Wylie stepped up and did what ever she had to do to keep herself and the child safe from the evil that was after him.The second timeline takes place in the summer of 2000 and is told from the POV of 12-year-old Josie. Josie’s parents were murdered in the farmhouse and her best friend Becky went missing. Again, Gudenkauf does an excellent job of describing the farms in this setting. This timeline starts the morning of the murders, and as we see the day playing out, we get a few murder suspects. Right from the start I was suspecting everyone. Josie was such a well written character and my heart just broke for her.In addition to these two timelines, we also get short chapters from the POV of a little girl. This girl and her mother are living in the basement of their home, well I should say they are locked in the basement by the girl’s father. We do not know who this girl and her mother are, but they both pulled at my heart strings. These chapters also gave me an Emma Donoghue “Room” vibe.I love how these seemly unconnected timelines eventually come together in an ending that had a few twists and left a few tears in my eyes.Heather Gudenkauf’s The Overnight Guest, is a suspenseful mystery that kept me guessing for the most part. I thought all of the characters and each timeline setting was very well written. I also loved how Gudenkauf slowly increased the tension in the present day timeline until I was on the edge of my seat at the end. I definitely want to check out more of Heather Gudenkauf’s books.',\n",
       "   '“Until now, she had learned to control light and dark. She couldn’t outrun it any longer. She squeezed her eyes shut.”This really grew on me by the end…it ran rather lukewarm in parts in the middle, but the ending is what really made me settle on 4/5 stars. There are three different perspectives the story takes place under: Wiley’s, a crime writer, in the present at an isolated farmhouse as she’s trying to finish her next novel, in the year 2000 when multiple familial homicides have occurred, and from the perspective of an abused mother and her child who are stuck within the confines of a small room. At first, they don’t seem related, but as the story progresses it begins to dawn remarkably on you just how interrelated they are.Wiley is used to running, it’s her go-to course of action when the going gets tough and she doesn’t know how to handle her emotions or her son, Seth. This time she just stays away longer, the quiet of the countryside keeping her company. Her emotions run high, and the snowstorm snows her in as only she and Tas, a stray mutt she takes in, try to make do with the resources they have. However, when Wiley makes the trek outside to scope things out, she comes across a little boy buried under snow on the ground, seemingly lifeless at first glance. The story only builds from here. Wiley does some serious introspection and looking back into her past: only to discover that what she should try to do is stay and work things through more often even if it pains her, is uncomfortable, or hard, as some of the most rewarding things are and come to be.“Homes were supposed to be safe havens, meant to protect. It was supposed to be a shelter from the elements, a fortress to keep out evil, and her home had betrayed Josie in the worst way.”The way the story was written didn’t always work for me: I thought the number of times people were throwing up was overdone and so were some of the more gruesome descriptions. I get that that can be the nature of the book, but sometimes it felt too much and distracted me from sitting with the heaviness and meaningfulness of the scene more fully.“She would be free from the black shadow that she had been trying to outrun, the shadow that haunted her for years.”However, the ending was what I really loved, as it was strong and left me with many thoughts and points of richly laid out inquisition. And Josie and Becky, who were part of the 2000 perspective, were completely heartwarming to read about, as was their genuine girlhood friendship, which involved jumping on a trampoline under the stars. Read this for an action-packed journey, which takes place in the haunted eeriness of the countryside and inclement weather with lots of revelatory insights surrounding love, grief, and loss.',\n",

Having gone through early midlife and child rearing days every essay written brought me back to that time like I had gone through it yesterday (spoiler alert, it was longer ago than I care to share).

       "  'reviews': ['** spoiler alert **The blurb for this book piqued my interest SO much. You hear about a bodyguard romance, you\\'re thinking female celebrity with a hulking male bodyguard. I sure was. And then you find it\\'s a hunky male celebrity and a short, ordinary female bodyguard. I had to know!!! (Also, I\\'m so upset about my own preconceptions!)I should have checked for content warnings before I started reading. We meet Hannah Brooks on the worst day of her life. Her mother has just died and her coworker/boyfriend broke up with her. The night after the funeral. (He\\'s awesome...) Her boss benches her when all she wants is a distraction, and she\\'s truly unraveling.THEN her ex goes on a mission with her best friend. I knew in my gut, that something was going on there. And I was right. Hannah doesn\\'t catch a break for the first 30-40% of this book. All she wants is to go on assignment out of town. She wants to escape and have a distraction. So her boss dangles an opportunity to do just that, if she does this one, puny assignment in her hometown.Jack Stapleton is great. He\\'s a bit too aloof about his own safety, but he\\'s a solid hero. I loved him. You\\'ll love him. Hannah definitely loves him.She agrees to fake date Jack Stapleton, for his safety, so his mom won\\'t worry and know about the stalkers and safety concerns.It was SO GOOD! I can say, I haven\\'t stayed up all night to finish a book in a looooong time. Especially not a book that I had to read through tears to get to the end. I mean this thing was good! The only reason I can\\'t give it 5 stars, is how close to a \"she\\'s not like regular girls\" narrative we get. She never says it, nobody ever says those words. But the vibes are absolutely there. We have the best friend who sleeps with her ex of like 2 days during the worst week of her life. We have the celebrity who is flabbergasted that anyone would choose her over them, and tries to humiliate her in front of a full Thanksgiving crowd. We have the female stalker who threatens to kill her in creative ways for being in Jack\\'s life. We had this awesome book that was SO close to putting all of these gender roles and stereotypes on their head, and then just....didn\\'t follow through all of the way. I\\'m sure I\\'m missing some big twist that was supposed to make those things subversive and stuff, but I can tell you I got REAL mad at 6am after reading and crying my eyes out all night, to have been duped into rooting against all these different women.It got better again. I mean I only took away one star for it. But it was rough for a hot second there. I still highly recommend this though. But be careful with yourself, it\\'s got some really heavy themes.',\n",
       "   \"Intelligent, lighthearted, and full of romance, this was exactly what I was hoping for... though I wouldn't have minded some steam, lol! It's my first from the author, so I wasn't sure if the vibe would be more women's fiction or romance, but it ended up being a great combination of the two. The romance is front and center throughout, though this is definitely the heroine's story. It's told exclusively from her point of view, and she's got some self-reflection and personal growth to go through before she can let love into her life. But it also feels like a low angst, slow burn romance too, complete with a fake relationship and a famous hero. I loved that our couple was forced to spend nearly every moment together, and neither one seemed to have any complaints about that. It's the kind of story where you have to puzzle out the hero's thoughts and feelings, which kept me engaged and interested throughout. And I had no trouble bingeing it in one sitting - this was very good.The story follows Hannah, a woman's whose past has shaped her into the person she is today. She works as a bodyguard, and it would take just the right guy to scale her walls and discover the soft center she hides beneath her bristly and business-like exterior. So when Hannah's estranged mother passes away and her support system crumbles around her, she hopes that burying herself in work with protect her from all of the unwelcome emotions that are creeping up on her. But when a new assignment - protecting a famous but reclusive actor - starts spiraling out of control, Hannah is left reeling. It's not long before she finds herself posing as the heartthrob's girlfriend and temporarily living on his family ranch. Spending time together brings them closer, but Jack is off-limits in more ways than one... and faking a relationship with an actor would lead anyone to question whether it's ALL an act.Much of the story is introspective and focused on Hannah's thoughts, but Jack is also an integral component. It's a true romance, just one that tackles some heavier issues and does not include any steam. Difficult subjects like cancer, the loss of a loved one, and addiction are included, but the overall tone is actually pretty upbeat. Jack and Hannah's connection is so easy to see, and I loved all of the ways they complement each other. They both heal old wounds throughout the story, and there were plenty of swoony vibes. Their relationship develops slowly, almost a friendship at first, and I can see why there was no spice included - though they form a bond semi-quickly, there are several obstacles in their way. I loved how much Jack appreciated Hannah's authenticity, and he adored the fact that she can be both tough and tender. He doesn't try to change her, and he seems to genuinely love the things that make her insecure about herself. All in all, it was super easy to fall for Jack, so I had plenty of patience for their relationship to evolve. This was an excellent first read from this new-to-me author - I loved it!Audio note: The audio is so good! Since the story is told exclusively from Hannah's point of view, there's a single female narrator. She does a great job of differentiating between the characters, and I loved her performance as Hannah. The audio enhances the story in a big way, infusing both emotion and emphasis into the text. And the narrator's voice was relaxing and easy to listen to, perfect for the tone of the book. This would also make an ideal workday listen - not only is the runtime short enough to finish in a single day, but the slow burn story and low/no heat level means that you won't be blushing at the office, lol. It's not somber enough to drag you down; it's lighthearted and a little playful, which will make the day fly by. I definitely recommend the audio.\",\n",
       "   'Listen, is this book going to ever come close to winning a Pulitzer? No. The story is predictable and the writing is average.HOWEVER, I laughed so much in this book. People love to dump on books like these because they \"lack substance\" or are (my most hated description) \"pedestrian.\" Quite frankly, I don\\'t give a crap what other people might think about those of us that love reading these books. It was absolutely ridiculous all the way through, but that\\'s exactly why I enjoyed it. I finished this book the night I opened it, I couldn\\'t put it down. And there were so many moments that left me literally laughing out loud. The way Center manages to capture the little things gave the picture in my head so much more detail. Things like how the characters react and facial expressions. It\\'s full on Hallmark Channel RomCom campy. And I loved every minute of it.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"Ah, what damage the demon alcohol has wrought. Don't expect a feel-good fantasy of redemption in a young gay romance.  In literary terms, better to rank it under tragedy not comedy. It stinks of the Irish Curse/alcohilism p set in 1980's Glasgow's post-inductrial tenements where slumming meets dire ends. Our hero's birth name is Mongo,  just the first of many curses foisted on him by his wastrel mum, Maureen. No father, siblings lost in their own struggles of self-preservation, Mongo longs for a maternal gesture that hints that he is loveable. Maureen's need of drink and the willingness to sell herself for it destroys Mongo's trust in himself and ability  to make choices. It is just plain nasty for the 15 year-old boy. It is not a family in crisis. It is a whole culture destroyed and only able to do evil to each other.The plot is rivetting. The erotic titilation restrained and unfulfilled The chronology goes back and forth so there is no set place or time. The dialogue is definitely Scottish; if you ever had trouble with the Northern brogue, it takes some effort to understand every word. By the end the reader has picked up the sense of Scottish reticent anger and frustration. This is not emo mooning and carping. It will make for a great movie just not a full season of streamed episodes.\",\n",
       "   'This book had a slow start, although it was probably the fact that the spoken words were all written in Scottish dialect.The telling of the story was nonetheless as powerful as I have ever read. I could see myself in bits and pieces. Good luck, Mungo!',\n",

Douglas has a very beautiful style of writing, and this story is so beautifully written.  I could not put it down.  The story is very sad, with a bit of humor and tenderness sprinkled through out.  It reminds me somewhat of Frank McCourt (Angela's Ashes and 'Tis).  Upon finishing this book I immediately purchased Shuggie Bain, which is also brilliant.  One of the best new authors I have come across in a very long while.  I hope we hear much more from Douglas.\",\n",
       "   \"Life is chaos mixed with madness and disrupted by little events that create a path to follow. Or be chased. Everything you do is being observed, evaluated, recorded, analyzed, and tangled with everyone else's lives in ways that defy the easy understanding and motivation that drives the contacts between people. Life is complicated and complex enough that it is unpredictable and interesting in spite our efforts to control it.Serendipity and unpredictable random events determine the history and legacy of families and friends. Opportunities knock us down and disasters pick us up in the daily interactions that keep changing everything that we try to understand as we try to predict the future.\",\n",

In Mungo’s youth, it was difficult to be his true self. So many others who aren’t LGBT live similar tragedies due to poverty, race, broken parents, etc.  Sometimes we are forced to accept, hoping for a glimmer of hope at the end.',\n",
       "   'Douglas Stuart can write, no question about that, and like the (even greater) writer of \"Lolita,\" he fearlessly takes on potentially salacious material with a masterful literary style. But while Nabokov\\'s artistry is a rhapsodic expression of a doomed pedophile\\'s lust and aching love, Stuart fails in his attempt to situate young Mungo\\'s sexual coming of age in a love story that rises above its sordid environment. We aren\\'t even allowed to respect Mungo\\'s love for his alcoholic mother through all her execrable, self-loving failures to nurture or protect him; instead, we must witness rape so brutal that some readers may resent having to endure it--all to demonstrate to us just how cruelly and miserably poor Mungo has been treated. But if Mr. Stuart cannot find a way to grow beyond his memorable depictions of the victimization of (his?) gay life amidst the anomie of economic collapse brought on by Thatcherism (oh yes! there\\'re plenty of Baddies, from drunken moms to toxic males to corporate rapacity), he may face a diminishing audience of readers who are willing to come back for more of the same, with each edition showing ever more horrifying degradation.

Hari goes in depth into things we all know a bit about, but he digs deeper and we get the result of his hard work with just turning the page. It is so easy to blame our frazzled thought patterns on ourselves or the internet or even 24-hour news cycles, but Hari shows us how this lack of attention has been growing and spreading for well over a century. He reminds us of what other people have done for change, and that fighting for our own focus and attention will be easier than their struggle if we JUST DO IT.  I am so impressed with Hari’s acceptance that he has not overcome focus problems for us or himself, with his ability to admit his preconceived notions about the problem were not accurate in some cases, and with his stern resolve to go into every facet of whatever direction his queries took him in order to uncover the reasons for the problem and the answers to the problem. Hari is not satisfied with a band-aid or a tylenol. He wants to know the root cause and how to cure the disease. I am very grateful to have read this book, and eternally grateful that Hari took three years of his life to give it to the world.',\n",
       "   'Perhaps, the unexpected gift of COVID-19 was the pause, a global pause that demanded self-examination and self-care during a time when the best we could do was to do was to isolate to mitigate contagion. And technology became a blessed curse at times, to the degree we realized the intrinsic need for human engagement and shared activities from conversations to games. Possibly, we all took time to notice much of our dependency, bordering on addiction, to technology. What we may not have realized is that our focus has been captured and manipulated through the technology. Children who have never been without technology have an even greater dependency and a greater loss of focus.What this book seeks to show through research, specifically interviews with leading experts in fields, is when, how, and why our ability to focus has been diminishing for decades and why we need to work to reclaim our focus to address global problems.',\n",

       "   'This is one of those books that I can\\'t say I enjoyed, but I\\'m very glad I read it.Like most people, I have problems focusing and staying on task at times.  The ubiquitous allure of social media being just a click away is an ever-present temptation that often becomes a self-imposed distraction.  I fight it, but I often lose the battle.In this incredibly researched, yet easy to read, book, author and journalist Johann Hari explains many of the reasons almost all of society is struggling with this issue.  Along the way I learned a few new terms like \"switch cost effect\" and \"surveillance capitalism\" that will help me improve my focus.Some of his solutions seem a bit extreme to me (and even scary - no way I want the government taking over Facebook!) but he throws them out for consideration and to get the reader thinking about this issue and how we can individually, and even collectively, reclaim our attention.  I specifically like how he tied our problems with focusing on fixing climate change with our attention crisis.  In that, I think Hari makes his best points.I\\'d recommend this book to anyone who\\'d like to reclaim some of their focus.  And I\\'d urge any parent with young children (or anyone dreaming of becoming a parent one day) to give this a read as he spends a lot of time on ADHD and ways we can improve children\\'s attention without drugs.Hari quotes someone as saying \"You don\\'t get what you don\\'t fight for\" and in that I think we can all agree.  Whether or not you think fighting for your attention (and for society to regain its ability to focus) is up to you.  I\\'d encourage you to read this book before deciding either way.',\n",

Your time is something you’re never going to get back and you can never re-give your time to your children.Stop wasting time. Buy this book and learn new ways to optimize your time, and stay off your phone you degenerates. But be grateful you can afford one. Now go read this book you’ll thank me later.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['The hype is correct: this book is moving, impactful, powerful, reflective, all the feels.  The writing superb, the plot gritty, the characters seem real, so real.  One of my all time favorite authors is John Irving because every word seems deliberate in his books, not every plot point or every paragraph, every. single. word.  And it has been a long time since I\\'ve read a book that strikes me in that same vein of the author being so in control of the story, and my (the reader\\'s) emotions being so completely at the mercy of the words to come.  I think I could read this book five more times and each time peel back a new layer and see something I hadn\\'t seen, or understood, or felt before.  I cried, I cheered, I sighed and unclenched my jaw, and I am still haunted by the lives of the characters.  Not just the \"main\" ones.  All of them, they all are real and fleshed out and have character arcs and live in shades of gray.  There are no checkboxes for skin tone or religion or sexual preference they each are more than a label, they are complex and real.  I could easily be convinced that they are in fact real people and that their world and stories are not fiction at all.  That is how well it reads, that is how hard it is to close the window on the world they let us see.  The book is YA (374 pages) and with the drugs, abuse, alcohol, relationship, complexities of it all, I would think 16 year old\\'s and up can, strike that, should, read this book.  The characters are Muslim, but it never even goes near being preachy, these are complex characters and stories, and remarkably there is no internalized Islamophobia or watering anything down, each character deals with faith, like everything else, in their own way.SYNOPSIS:The story bounces between the past in Lahore, Pakistan and the present in Juniper, California.  In Lahore it is Misbah\\'s story and in the desert it is her son\\'s, Salahudin and a girl she has taken under her wing, Noor\\'s.  When the book starts we see Sal with a drunk father dropping him off at school where his girlfriend is waiting, and his best friend, Noor, not speaking to him for the last few months after she confessed to bein in love with him.  Noor lives with her uncle after her entire village in Pakistan was destroyed when she was 6, and he wants nothing to do with Pakistan, Islam, or Noor going to college.  He owns a liquor store and makes Noor work there.  Sal\\'s mom is sick and has always been their for Noor, so when she takes a turn for the worse, Noor and Sal are brought back together, Noor\\'s uncle is enraged that she is missing shifts, and Sal\\'s father is constantly searching for the bottom of a bottle.  Things are bad, but they are about to get a whole lot worse.  Sal\\'s mom dies, the motel Sal\\'s family owns is in severe debt and the options for saving it are less than ideal.  The small town starts to feel familiar as everyone\\'s stories are fleshed out in Juniper and Lahore and two star-crossed narrators are forced to confront both the stresses of high school and impending adulthood, and deep, dark realities of abuse, loss, and generational trauma.WHY I LIKE IT:The book could have been a thousand pages, and it still would have felt too short.  Much like her fantasy writing, the book seems to start with world building and roping the reader in to thinking that they can handle what is about to come, then much like a band-aid being pulled off, the pain hits, and the wound starts bleeding again.  Somehow despite it all, you can\\'t look away, you can\\'t stop reading, there is hope.  Hope for the characters, hope for happy endings, hope for survival and peace.I absolutely love the quality of writing, things dangled early on, come back, often with subtly and restraint that you could easily miss them.  When discussing the book with @muslimmommyblog, I felt like we both were finding threads we had possibly not considered and connections that added nuance and staying power to the plot.So often, the more religious a character in literature is, the stricter they are presented, the less kind they are seen, but in this book it was the opposite, the loving couple were the imam and his defense attorney wife, the glue that radiated kindness to Sal, Noor, and so much of the town is a hijab wearing strong woman.  So many tropes and stereotypes were uprooted, tossed aside, and reimagined.  There is compassion for a Muslim alcoholic, a liquor store being the employment of a Muslim, consequences for dealing drugs, yet nothing \"haram\" is really ever glorified, it is gritty and repulsive, but there is no judgement, there is only understanding and sadness.  Palpable despair that rattles your bones and makes you wish the world was different.I don\\'t want to spoil the book, I was able to read it largely not knowing what the plot would delve in to. In many ways the trigger warning at the beginning was the only thing that braced me for what was to come. The level of religion and how it was woven is through the gentleness of some of the characters and hatred of others, was expertly done.  There are not ayats in the Quran quoted or speeches given, there is love, and faith and hope that manifest as duas and longing and finding ways to be Muslim in action, not just in appearance. When the characters start to make-out their Islamic conscious is drawn in, when they grapple with their hope and future- trust in something bigger is considered. It is not a Muslim book, not even an Islam centered book, perhaps Muslamic, but really about characters who are Muslim and dealing with the cards they have been dealt.',\n",
       "   '‘“There’s more to life than the things in front of you…sometimes we hold on to things we shouldn’t. People. Places. Emotions. We try to control all of it, when what we should be doing is trusting in something bigger.”’ S.T., All My RageI’ve always been a believer that things happen for a reason; that things come into your life when you need it. Whether that’s some god, goddess, the God, fate, destiny, the universe, etc. is not the question I will ever ultimately find the answer to. I’ve wanted to read “All My Rage” for a long time because I adore Sabaa Tahir and I always want to support my favorite authors.AMR tells the story of Noor, Salahudin, and Misbah. It explores the different ways we deal with grief, loss, anger, rage, love, family, betrayal, forgiveness - life. Ms. Tahir beautifully weaves the story of two young best friends, on the cusp of realizing they could be more, with more life lessons than anyone of any age could or should have to deal with.AMR came to me under the guise of earning a badge for a kindle unlimited reading challenge. I finally had enough in credits and a small balance on a gift card, so I purchased it. I knew it was a heavy book, but I didn’t realize that it would help me process my grief and help me let go of all my rage. I also didn’t realize I would be a sobbing mess by the end (well done Ms. Tahir. Well done). It was the perfect storm - everything lined up and it was time for me read this and deal with some of my issues.“Rage can fuel you. But grief gnaws at you slow, a termite nibbling at your soul until you’re a whisper of what you used to be.” I truly don’t know if this quote could resonate with me more if it tried. It was this combination of 26 words that ultimately broke me down and had me weeping. The lead up to it (i.e. the rest of the book) had a hand in helping with that, but those two sentences are what had me sobbing uncontrollably until the end. (Okay, and for a little while after)For a person who tends to forget a lot of what she’s read, this book will more than likely be the one to sit with me, at the forefront of my mind, for a long, long while.If I could give infinity stars, I absolutely would. No hesitation.',\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"When I was a teenager one of the things that intrigued me was Explorers, especially those who searched for the source of the Nile. As a result, I have read and collected several books on the topic. It was automatic when I saw Candice Millard had written her latest book on this subject that I would pre-order a copy. I have read and liked her three previous books (especially THE RIVER OF DOUBT). I would recommend that if you have never read another book on this subject her new book is a good starting point. You might even want to find a copy of the 1990 movie that tracks this same story, THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON. I thought I would use this review to also mention some of my favorite books on the subject of the search for the Nile.Millard’s book for the most part only focuses on Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke's searches (and Speke’s lone discovery of the source). She also elevates the major role played by their African guide Sidi Muarak Bombay, a former slave who co-led other White English Explorers (such as Henry Morton Stanley). Bombay helped Stanley to find Livingston and became the first to cross the entire African continent, sea to sea,  from East to West with explorer Cameron. It was not until 2009 that the Royal Geographic Society commissioned a major museum exhibit that recognized native explorers’ contributions.I still have my first book on the subject of the River Nile. Read some 60 years ago all I can recall is that it was one of those books that amazed its teenage reader. It is Alan Moorehead’s THE WHITE NILE (1960). The book includes the Speke/Burton exploration in addition to Livingston, Samuel Baker with his wife, Stanley and finally covering the Muslim uprising that killed “Chinese” Gordon leading to Kitchener's British victory. Moorehead wrote a second book, THE BLUE NILE (1962) which includes the history of this major river tributary.Another book that digs deeper into the amazing person that was Richard Burton (not the actor who borrowed his name). Edward Rice’s CAPTAIN SIR RICHARD BURTON: THE SECRET AGENT WHO MADE THE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA, DISCOVERED THE KAMA SUTRA, AND ROUGHT THE ARABIAN NIGHTS TO THE WEST (1990). In addition, led with Speke the expedition into the Mountains of the Moon in search of the source of the Nile. Burton spoke 29 languages and was long before Lawrence of Arabia an Englishman who emerged himself in foreign cultures. Like Lawrence Burton was an obsessive writer of great talent and intellect who immersed himself in Araian Muslim culture (who disguised as a Muslim entered Mecca).More biographies and focus have highlighted Burton over Speke. If you do not know the story it is best I not give it away here except to say Speke did not have the charisma or talent to provide for a lasting legacy. Richard Burton married late in life to a very interesting woman, Isabel. Their relationship and Burton’s story is well told in Mary S. Lovell’s biography, A RAGE TO LIVE, RICHARD AND ISABEL BURTON (1998).A very entertaining book about a fabulously interesting footnote to the people attracted to the challenge of the search for the Nile’s source is Pat Shipman’s TO THE HEART OF THE NILE, LADY FLORENCE BAKER AND THE EXPLORATION OF CENTRAL AFRICA (2004). Florence’s family was killed in the Hungry revolution which lead to her being kidnapped from a refugee camp and sold into slavery. Trained to be in a harem. At age 14 she was to be auctioned but a wealthy Englishman, Samuel Baker facilitated her escape (perhaps being outbid). Eventually, the two married and through a continued journey to keep Florence’s background hidden settled on an arduous attempt to journey upriver to find the source of the Nile. Instead, they found Lake Albert returning to celebrity in England.Of all these books one stands out as the most entertaining, well-written, and has become one of my all-time favorites. Tim Jeal’s STANLEY, THE IMPOSSIBLE LIFE OF AFRICA’S GREATEST EXPLORER (2007). Know mostly for his finding (with Bombay) Dr. Livingston famously saying, “Dr. Livingston, I presume?”Stanley’s reputation has been tarnished over decades casting him as an anti-African imperialist caught up in the madness of King Leopold of Belgium’s crimes in the Congo. Tim Jeal’s book does much to rehabilitate Stanley still warts apparent. Stanley’s is an amazing life story, serving for a time on both the South and North side in the American Civil War. In addition to searching for the source of the Nile (finally confirming that Speke’s Lake Victoria theory was correct) he also searched for the source of the Congo River. He was knighted in 1897. (Check this extraordinary book out.)Following STANLEY Tim Jeal wrote, EXPLORERS OF THE NILE, THE TRIUMPH AND TRAGEDY OF A GREAT VICTORIAN ADVENTURE (2011). Jeal, much like Alan Moorhead in THE WHITE NILE covers almost all of the major Explorers that attempted to find the source of the Nile. So when I saw that Candice Millard had chosen this much-told story I wondered why beyond it is one that never bores in its telling. And Millard does the story justice and I enjoyed revisiting all of these interesting stories and characters. My problem with the book is that I did not find a lot that was fresh or new to the story. But that is more my problem than that of the author, as she has written a great book for a new generation. Those who are captivated by this adventure and the conflict between these two strong-willed men should enjoy Millard’s fine telling.\",\n",
       "   \"Mild Spoiler AlertThis is a well written, easily read, book that peaked my interest in the region more than I have been to date. I was able to locate geographic areas and place names on my map of Africa (not always possible in some histories) and found it interesting that not every Englishman who went to Africa at that time was looking to slaughter some animal and that ants were more of a problem than lions. There's a particularly gruesome antecdote about a black beetle that will have you packing ear plugs.It doesn't shy away from the existence and impact of the slave trade on the ability to conduct these expeditions nor does it overdo or hide the day to day mysogyny customary at the time in European society. But that is not the focus. The focus is on RIchard Burton and John Speke. Their relationship and their common, yet advesarial, goal of finding the source of the Nile for fame and fortune.On the one hand, it's somehow comforting to know that humans have been greedy, petty, jealous, and cruel to each other since the beginning of recorded time. Sort of reinforces the idea this is who we are. Narrow-minded, vindictive, entitled and ruthless when in power, traumatized and angry when not. Tending toward gossiping, lying, violence and general criminality to maintain, secure, and increase what we have.On the other, it's tedious that we haven't changed and, apparently, aren't likely to before this iteration of civilization dies off.I actually picked this up because the author was compared to Erik Larson. I haven't found an author that can weave seemingly unrelated events together into a comprehensive overview of an historical event like him. This was not such a book but it is an excellent presentation of a historical event that is well presented in context of the times in which it occured.Where River of the Gods follows a chronological approach to Richard Burton's expedition(s) to the source of the Nile, Larson would have contrasted it with, perhaps, the evolution of the First Indian Revolution and experiences there of Edward Burton or Edward Speke.Or perhaps he would have taken us along a bit on CHalres Darwin's attempts to publish On The Origins of the Species at about the same time as Speke returned to England and claimed the win. And there's a whole pornograghy angle and the Rwandan Genocide in 1994.What the author does offer are many bits of what could be called extended related trivia that was occuring along the same chronological path and pace that does tantalize and, if you have some knowledge of world history, help bring context to both the characters and the time. And encourages further research.So, while I don't agree she is yet an Erik Larson style author, I will read other things she's done and will do.\",\n",
       "   'Really a 4.5-star book. This is a fast-paced history of Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke, two English explorers who made names for themselves by exploring \"darkest Africa\" in the 1850s. The book describes their travails as they search for the source of the White Nile. While today it\\'s hard to grasp why this search was such a public fascination, it nevertheless garnered great attention. Both men were courageous and had an abundance of intestinal fortitude. They both sought glory for England. But Speke\\'s motivation was much more for self-aggrandizement. Millard paints a clear picture of the jealousies, rivalries, and politics that accompanied the search. She\\'s forthright in her presentation of how the belief in the superiority of the white Christian males really created many evil situations. Similarly it\\'s clear that 19th century Christianity was not the moral force for good that many people think it is. Recommended for fans of history. Highly recommended for fans of the history of exploration.',\n",
       "   'I was disappointed in this story. I had eagerly awaited cracking open the spine to read the contents of the adventures of the discovery of the White Nile’s beginning. Much to my chagrin were the endless tales of bickering, deceit, bitterness and betrayal and very little detail on the  discoveries large and small made along the way. I believe Millard to be a brilliant author but found the storyline to be tedious and a turn off.']},\n",

Love? Or maybe hatred?At some points exciting and others heartbreakingThere’s something so liberating about a secret for the takingI absolutely loved this book. It was beautifully written and honestly surprising! I, like nearly everyone else, know very little about the time during which Agatha Christie went missing. So anything related to that storyline I just eat up. Weaving fact with fiction can be a tall task, and de Gramont did it with ease. I found her version to be utterly believable. And the characters. Wow! What an artful job she did with each of them. Despite what I wanted to think, I found myself cheering for almost all of them (except for Archie. For obvious reasons). I also thought that de Gramont’s ideas of what happened during that time were fresh and unique. It is not an obvious storyline, but one that packed a punch.I found myself having internal arguments over what I believed on various points – a sure sign that both sides of the story held weight. I thought this was an incredibly clever and skillful mirroring of the fact that there is so much mystery surrounding Christie’s disappearance. De Gramont paid respect to the lack of information on this time by not wrapping the story up completely. While I think this really honored the history and added some authenticity to the book, this is, in the end, what made me knock off a star. The writing and the storytelling in the book are a full five. I just really need my books to be wrapped up nicely. It’s not a true cliffhanger, but it’s not complete. This is really a me issue – the author certainly cannot help that no one knows what happened in real life – but I can’t help that it bothers me.I will, without question, pick up more books by this talented author.',\n",

       "   \"I really enjoyed this! Nina de Gramont's speculative take on what might have been behind Agatha Christie's 11-day disappearance in 1926 offers a rich cast of nicely-developed characters. In the lead is Nan, the other woman whom Christie's husband plans to leave her for. There's also Archie, the wayward husband; Chilton, their daughter, Teddy; Finnbar, Nan's former lover; Chilton, a scarred World War I veteran and police inspector who's brought in to investigate; and, of course, Agatha herself. As the first-person narrator, Nan is much more sympathetic than you'd expect as she slowly reveals her reasons for wanting to break up the Christies' marriage. De Gramont paints a vivid picture of England after the first World War, and a harrowing picture of the Ireland home for unwed mothers where much of Nan's backstory takes place. The story of her ill-fated romance with Finnbar, who has also been scarred by the war, is beautifully drawn. And Agatha is shown as a properly-raised Englishwoman who's been pushed too far to maintain her traditional stiff upper lip, but who still shows strength, grace and decency as the story unfolds. I found some of the plot turns in the last fourth of the book pretty unlikely, which kept this from being a five-star read for me, but I still recommend it highly.\",\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"Kwame Alexander has written a book that I will be thinking about for a long time to come.  I suspected what might happen going in to the book from what I'd been hearing about it, but it was still devastating when it happened.  As the story opens, readers meet Kofi, an 11-year-old Ashante boy from Upper Kwanta. He goes to school where he is taught English, and punished when he does wrong.  He likes Ama, a girl in his class who must work for her aunt and uncle to keep a roof over her head.  He loves to swim with his best friend Ebo, even if Ebo has a big mouth.  And his loud-mouth, bullying cousin drives him to distraction.  He admires his brothers athleticism and loves to listen to his grandfather's stories.The book is divided into seven chapters which begin with prose told in the voice of Kofi's grandfather.  Each chapter is made up of poems through which Kofi tells his story.  The first half of the story revolves around Kofi's home and family.  When his family attends the Kings Festival in which his brother is to wrestle, things go tragically wrong.  Sadly, tragedy leads to more tragedy and Kofi's whole life is ripped apart.  As I read the beautiful verses, my heart broke for Kofi and his struggle to find hope in his changed circumstances.While written for older middle grade readers, this is a book that teens and adults could benefit from as well.  Not only is the writing beautiful in the stunning poetry that Alexander presents, but the imagery and themes are powerful as well.  The ugliness of what Kofi sees and experiences makes this most appropriate for older middle grade readers and up.  Especially sensitive readers might have a hard time with some of the content.  Those who do pick it up will find Kofi a great character to root for especially at the end where he has to make a choice to keep fighting or to give up.  And while the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, it does end on a hopeful note.  I eagerly await the rest of the trilogy to find out where Kofi ends up and how he choses to follow his dreams in the face of great difficulties.\",\n",

       "   'The Door of No Return depicts well the harrowing violence and tragedy of the Atlantic slave trade. Readers travel from a peaceful community in the Asante Kingdom of 1860 to the “door of no return” in Cape Coast Castle. For me the strength of a work of historical fiction is knowing that the story could really happen at the date and in the setting depicted. The Door of No Return doesn’t meet this standard.The castle and door remain for visitors to see and contemplate the slave trade in present day Ghana. But the story could not have taken place in 1860 as the author states. The governments of Britain and the United States outlawed their citizens’ participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807. Within ten years all northern European countries had done the same although illegal trading continued for some time. In 1860 the British government had authority over Cape Coast Castle. There was no slave trading at the castle then nor had there been for decades.A second discrepancy is the depiction on the map of Volta Lake in Ghana. The lake was created by the Akosombo Dam built across the Volta River and completed in 1965. The Volta River existed in 1860 but not the lake.Accuracy in historical fiction is fundamental so readers may fully integrate a story with their knowledge of the history of the cultures described. I hope these discrepancies will be corrected.',\n",
       "   \"I originally bought this book for me. Then I bought another copy for a teen cousin who is just learning the joy of reading.This story is great! I could stop there, but since I read the 398-page story portion  in less that two sittings, great is not a good enough adjective.The Door of No Return is either a children's book written for adults, or an adult book written for children. The style is very different with each heading designed to pull the reader to the next page and then the next.It is a universal story about growing up and tradition and what we learn from our elders. It is about family through a child's eye and how early relationships develop.It is about young love and how life can change like a river, from just flowing along  one minute then changing to white-water rapids in an instant.Even though I knew based on the title what had to happen, I talked out loud and kept telling Kofi to stay away from that darn river at night. Listen to your maame Kofi.Read it before it becomes a movie and all the best parts are left out or changed.\",\n",

However, Sofie is one of the privileged Germans as her husband's builds rockets for the Nazis.  It is such a tragedy how good people were forced to compromise their standards in an attempt to save the lives of their family members.  I think this is a story that needed to be told.  We need to know Sofie's story.  But that is not all.  This is also Lizzie's story, an American girl whose dreams are blown away with the dust that consumes her farm and takes the lives of her parents.  Her life intersects with that of Sofie, and we see how war can continue to destroy lives even after a cease fire.\",\n",
       "   'The story is told from two perspectives, an American woman whose life spanned the loss and hardship of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. The other character is a displaced German woman whose life and values were compromised by the Nazi reign of Germany. The story is woven together by the compulsive interactions of these two war torn traumatized characters. It is a great piece of historical fiction.',\n",

She and her husband eventually found themselves in a situation that threatened their lives and the lives of their children.  The book became a real page turner for me.  Terrible things were happening and they had to make choices. The question that kept coming to mind was, “what would I have done given the choices they had?”The book follows the lives of two women, one American and one German.  I found Lizzie’s (American) story interesting; dust bowl, Great Depression, losing the farm and her parents.  But her character served me best by showing the strong emotions Americans had against Germans for years after the war ended.',\n",

The average reader will not notice those things, though; yet, for the sense of accuracy, correctness would be nice.  There are numerous events that bring back memories, many of them not so nice.  It is true that there are always two sides to every issue, and, therefore, one should not judge others based only on one's own very limited experiences.\",\n",

       "  'reviews': ['First 5 star read (and first read) of 2023!This book was such a journey. It was a long (500+ pages) read! However, it was well worth it because it was well written with colorful characters! You know…the ones you “love” and the ones you “love to hate”! It follows the Seagrave children, their family, friends and trials and tribulations throughout their lives.The starting year is 1919 and the main character is a strong, independent and imaginative female named Cristabel Seagrave. She is the “leader” and the protective one of the Seagrave siblings. At the age of three, when the book starts, Cristabel is clearly ahead of her time; an old soul, if you will. Flossie, her half sister (by Cristabel’s step mother, Rosalind and her father, Jasper) was dubbed “The Veg” by Rosalind because she thought she looked like a vegetable (remember; those you love to hate people?!). Flossie started off as weak and insecure (who wouldn’t with a wicked parent), but grew into her beautiful and kind, loving personality with strength and grace.Digby, Flossie’s half brother and Cristabel’s cousin ((treated as her brother); Rosalind, mother and Jaspers brother, Willoughby) were very close. He had a lot of weight on his shoulders being the only male heir, mother (Rosalind’s) favorite child and shining star of his sister (cousin) Cristabel.Cristabel, upon finding a dead whale on the beach and having the bones moved up toward the estate, made it into a theater. She had such a creative mind after reading her father’s books…where, at the “Whalebone Theater” she would enlist members of the family and friends to be in her productions and recreations of those stories.There was definitely a treasure trove of remarkable characters navigating through the drinking and party lifestyle of the 20’s. Then, moving on to the turbulent and horrific times of WWII. Every one of the three Seagrave siblings had a huge role in their respective responsibilities in that war and it was extremely addicting to follow their path.I am so glad that I picked this one up (it is our first of the year book club read)! I savored the storyline and adored the characters! I thought about only giving this 4 stars due to the length (and admittedly slow parts at times)…but I just thought the author was so talented in making me fall in love with her characters  and vast story, that I had to bump up to FIVE!',\n",
       "   'Welcome to Chilcombe, \"a many-gabled, many chimneyed, ivy-covered manor house with an elephantine air of weary grandeur...it has huddled on a wooden cliff overhanging the ocean for four hundred years.\" At this Dorset estate in the year 1919, Cristabel Seagrave awaited the arrival of her new mother, Rosalind, \"a poised London debutante.\" Jasper Seagrave, widower, sought a young wife to provide an heir for Chilcombe. After the Great War and a shortage of suitable husbands, Rosalind settled for Jasper.Rosalind had no love for her firstborn, a daughter. \"... it looks like a vegetable...but at least she will have a film star name...Florence.\" An heir was what everyone wanted...boys could drive motors...be interested in snails, maps and warfare. Finally, a son and heir...Digby.The Seagrave children had far from an idyllic childhood. Cristabel provided adventures for her half-sister Flossie aka \"the Veg\" and cousin Digby. She would tell Digby and Flossie stories. By secretly borrowing books from the study, Cristabel entered the world of Shakespeare and Homer. History, romance and adventure were now at her fingertips! The creative children entertained themselves with sock puppet shows using cardboard backdrops.\"After a night of thunderstorms, the air is as fresh as clean laundry. The chilly mist...swept away, lifting like stage curtains to reveal the coastline in its spring colours...[Cristabel] discovered a dead whale washed up on the pebbles...[She ] has just turned twelve; there isn\\'t much she doesn\\'t know. She had read nearly all the books in the house...She admires things done in an adept manner...the feeling of being up in front on her own...high on her whale, looking down at Digby and the Veg.\" The Whalebone Theatre will soon be born. \"Their most-loved books have been read so many times...But the worlds contained within the books do not remain between the covers, they seep out and overlay the geography of their lives.\"The Chilcombe estate had hosted many guests including a Russian painter named Taras. \"If the front of Taras is the artist-entertainer, the back reveals the lifter-labourer-the graft behind the artistry.\" With limited resources and a bit of ingenuity, the whale\\'s bones were crafted into an outdoor theatre. Taras volunteered to paint stage sets. Costumes needed were made from repurposed items. Actors would include children, Rosalind, household staff and visiting guests. Cristabel wanted to perform The Iliad. Taras created \"a Troy and a wooden horse...\". The Seagrave Estate Presents \"The Iliad\" under the direction of Cristabel Seagrave. The audience has been seated. Quiet please!Lessons learned from performing, during the ten year span before WWII, were of great assistance to the Seagraves. Cristabel, an undercover agent parachuted into France, was able to easily change identities as needed while helping the Resistance Fighters. Digby, on a different secret mission, was reported missing. The Veg aka Flossie, provided evenings of low key entertainment, morale boosters for troops passing through Dorset. Interlaced within the framework of the story were wartime letters between the siblings and newspaper reviews of Whalebone Theatre presentations from 1928-1938.The pages of \"Whalebone Theatre\" by debut author Joanna Quinn are arguably an ode to the lifelong, uplifting healing power of books, theatre and music. This ambitious, captivating read of historical fiction is highly recommended.',\n",
       "   'Perhaps, the loss of innocence of the children growing in this  weathered manor, raised as much by wild as by staff or family, is the metaphor for the inescapable state of Europe post WWII, which is why every fleeting stage of imaginative play on a beach side in a whale bone theater becomes so precious, so vital.',\n",
       "   \"I sometimes wonder, when I'm reading a piece, if the author really understands his or her subject matter.  Not so here.  Detailed and interesting.  Characters that evolve in interesting arcs, even minor characters.  A convincing sweep of time.  A good one.\",\n",
       "   \"I have finished this book but don't quite know what to make of it. Four stars are not quite enough but five seems too many.  Definitely five stars for character development, lyrical prose, continuity across the timeline.  Four stars for the slow pace and slightly depressing family of misfits.  It certainly is unique and very well written.  Engaging in a slow and steady way.\",\n",
       "   'This book was advertised on the Today show and I needed something to read that kept my interest and wasn’t self help! Couldn’t put it down.',\n",
       "   \"Now that I am finally finished with this book, I will say that I liked it.  This is a long (550 pages) book that in the beginning does not seem to go very fast.  The blurb does not really describe what the book is about.  The whale washes up on shore fairly early in the story, but the ribcage doesn't become a theater until much later, and the plot changes gears about the same time.  So the Whalebone Theater is referred to from time to time, but I think it is really a metaphor for a time in the characters' lives that was important but fleeting.  I enjoyed the second part of the book much more than the first part, so if you start reading and feel like stopping, keep going because it gets more interesting later.\"]},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['We All Want Impossible Things by Catherine Newman is the story of the lifelong friendship between two women, Ash and Edi, the latter now in hospice. As Edi moves towards death, Ash surrounds her with love and assembles a community of other family members, friends, and hospice workers to accompany her on this journey. The finality is painful, but the long days and dwindling hours are also filled with humor and outright joy for life’s gifts. Newman’s novel is a gift to dying. While aspects of the tale are somewhat idealized — the women’s friendship, their respective families, and the residential hospice facility itself — the bodily humiliation and emotional grief of death are portrayed with honesty. As a fiction writer myself (see my Amazon author page www.amazon.com/author/asewovenwords), I’m impressed by the authenticity of Newman’s characters, especially the self-absorbed but self-aware Ash. As a certified end-of-life doula, I appreciate the realistic depiction of dying. It’s messy and draining, but also a time to tie up loose ends and magnify love. Edi is faced and graced with it all. Don’t we all deserve the “good death” that Newman portrays?',\n",

At times funny, at times achingly raw this is not a story about perfect Saints but rather the perfectly imperfect people who love their dying friend and each other. Loved this because truly, we all want at least one impossible thing.',\n",

I am not sure I have ever felt so reflected in a story, in the beautiful, unguarded way all of the humans in this book interacted and in the openness of talking about something few of us are comfortable with—death.And the friendship, portrayed in this book, oh the friendship! Made me think of my closest friends, how easily and deeply we connect, how much grace we give each other, how deeply we know each other and what a gift that is. I just loved this. I ate it up. It's funny, and sad, and beautiful and absurd. And, having read it as I was preparing to say goodbye to my father-in-law, it was also really, really helpful.Content warning that there is a pregnancy loss in it, as well as, well, death, because that's kinda what the whole thing is about. Although it's really more about life. It's perfect.\"]},\n",

The history of a person needs to be less about the color of the skin and more about the person. What a devastating story for Covey and friends. It's so hard for the characters. The author did a good job of evoking all the feels.\",\n",
       "   \"Whine. Whine. Whine. It seems like that is all the characters are doing. And at 400 pages, that gets old. Fast.But let's back up. This (overrated) novel by Charmaine Wilkerson tells the multigenerational story of a family from an unnamed island in the Caribbean, and the tale is woven by jumping back and forth in time and place and character. While this is a common literary technique, it takes real skill to pull it off. Wilkerson doesn't have that skill. The extremely short chapters—some just a paragraph or two long—switch topics and characters and timelines so quickly and at times so randomly that the effect is jarring and disorienting.This is the story of Covey, short for Coventina, the daughter of Johnny Lyncook and Mathilda Brown. He is Chinese. She is Black. But Covey is soon heartbroken when Mathilda disappears one night. She runs away from a life she hated but leaves behind a confused little girl, who is raised by Pearl, the family's cook and housekeeper. Because of something truly horrific that her father does, Covey also disappears from the island, fleeing to England and eventually adopting the name Eleanor. She then leads a convoluted undercover life that is filled with tragedy and fleeting bits of happiness. The other part of the story is told after Covey's death, when her grown children, Byron and Benny, listen to a tape-recording Covey has made, explaining everything. This sends them into a tailspin because it has turned their supposed family history and identity into a pile of lies. And that's saying something because both are already filled with resentment and bitterness long before their mother even died. When the pieces of this long, dragged-out story finally come together, the ending is treacly sweet.The novel is one big soap opera—and not a fun, sassy soap opera, but rather one that is melodramatic, overly sentimental, and very slow-paced. One horrible thing after another happens. Byron and Benny are consumed with so much anger toward each other that they don't speak, a classic TV soap opera ploy to limit critical communication and further the ridiculous plot. And when they do talk, they whine. Incessantly.This is such a shame because the story Wilkerson is trying to tell is an important one. But the meaning, import, and historical significance of that story is lost in the amateurish structuring of the novel.One clever part of the novel is how Wilkerson uses food, beginning with the traditional Caribbean recipe of black cake, a kind of plum pudding that takes months to make, to tell the characters' stories, hopes, and dreams. Unfortunately, the novel is as dense as the cake.\",\n",
       "   'I enjoyed this book and think the author did a terrific job of telling a complicated story.  The characters were believable and I liked how everything tied together at the end with a twist I didn’t see coming.  The only thing I DIDN’T like was how the author seemed to be obligated to pull in so many ‘current’ themes even when they didn’t add anything to the story — almost like there was a check-off list:  has to be at least one LGBT character; has to have a violence-against-women scene; has to be a rape scene; has to have an unprovoked anti-police scene; and a highly-talented-black-man-passed-over-for-promotion scene.

       "   'I picked up this book for many reasonsone, it was from an author of color so I expected to find cultural refrences which(reason 2) would dominate book since (reason 3) it is a NYT bestseller and was recommended by (Read with Jenna) whoever that is!Unfortunately, the things I disliked in this book way outweighed the things I liked (which could be counted on one hand)1- the style of writing was not consistent, and though I understand that it is in the third person narrative, it felt like a children book sometimes \"Benny went, Benny saw, Benny knew that Benny..\" what is that???//2- TOO MANY CHARACTERs\\' POVs!!!! and a lot of them we didnt need to know about. add to that, if this story was presented because Eleanor was telling it through a recordind, so how did she know what happened to these characters after she left? why did the writer interfer to explain their situation3- the over ubandant story-tellings. It was like story upon story upon story. just stick to a specific plot line4- the generalization of the story. I went into this book thinking it would be cultural and something unique to the Carribean islands or the backgroung of the mixed race, and although there were little, the story itself was not specific to this culture. anything that happened in this story could have happened, and probably still happenes, to any woman of any culture.5- The Black Pass. I mean by that is when a black writer gives him/her self the permission to write something that they do not allow other non-Black or non-ethnic writers to do.how many times white writers were backlashed because \"they killed the black character too soon\" or \"they made the only Asian character evil\" or \"they werent creative in naming their POC characters\"but it was Ok for this writer to take the only Chinese character in this book, gives him a name like \"Lin\" and make him a drunk, a gambler, a bad parent, a bad husband, and a child beater. not to mention selling her child to save his lifeand it only took him losing 2 wives and a daughter to check back on his life??????????I wonder if a white author did that with the only black character or the only POC character, what would have happened?6- the struggles felt trivial. Oh your parents did not agree with you immediately on your sexual choices, oh poor baby!Oh your parents hid their background truth from you to protect you and give you the best life, HOW DARE THEY?Oh your sister did not call you after you did not stand up with her, how sorry we are to you?I mean, were these really worth writing a book about????on the other hand, what Covey went through was the center and should have been the main focus, but the story deflected so many times you almost forget about her7- the underline message that this book is trying to say that parents, all their sacrifices and hardship, all their work and caring, means nothing if they did not agree with your choices.Benny\\'s parents wanted the best for her, made sure that she would go to good college and have education, but how dare they! Benny knows what is best for her, she stormed out of the house after they tolerating her fluxuating from one major to another. and to think that she would have accomplished something! Oh NO, SHE WAS A LOSER. she refused to let her parents dictate her life but allowed abusive men to do that! how smartplease remember that PARENTS DO KNOW BEST sometimes8- non of the other characters, besides Covey and Gibbs, were likable or reliatable. As a matter of fact, they were selfish and self-centered. every one was thinking about themselves.I found myself skipping many pages once i reached the 50% mark and just wanted to finish this bookeven the happy ending wasnt all that']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['I am a therapist specializing in cPTSD.  There are many well-written aspects of this book and it is well-researched.  However, as a psychotherapist specializing in PTSD and cPTSD, I have a few issues:1.  Just because someone has a PhD does not make them a good therapist.  It’s not about book smarts or education.  It’s about how one can connect to and work with the relational aspects of trauma.  These comments about MA vs PhD pissed me off.  I am not a PhD, mostly because I have an education background in biochemistry and neuroscience (undergraduate degrees), having worked in biotechnology for 15 years.  I don’t need a PhD to have knowledge and skill to address relational trauma.2.  I am a certified EMDR therapist, trained in 2001.  I have been using EMDR therapy in my practice for over 20 years with consistently effective results in addressing cPTSD.  I also have a cohort of excellent somatically-based colleagues who also effectively treat cPTSD, most of us lowly MA or MS-level LPC’s or LCSW’s (not PhD’s).  Not all EMDR therapists are created (or trained) equally.  Check out Dr. Arielle Schwartz, a friend and exceptionally skilled colleague.  Yes, a PhD but that’s not what makes her exceptional.  Check out her books and videos.3.  I am also trained in IFS.  “Mr. Sweater Vest” is not representative of IFS, as presented in this book. At all, sadly.  “The Hulk” as presented here is a “part” that served as a protector.  Too bad it apparently wasn’t addressed.  And no mention of Self energy?There are many poignant aspects of this well-written book.  I have compassion and appreciation for the author and her courage to heal.  However, I am frustrated by her cynicism and negativity, painting a slanted portrayal of effective approaches to healing cPTSD.',\n",
       "   'I’m an LMSW whose focus in grad school was mental health and substance abuse. I’ve read a lot of books on trauma and its innumerable affects on the body and the brain. I’m also someone who has been on my own healing journey and recovery from trauma. This is the best book I’ve read on this topic. The honesty, the lived-experience, and the truth Foo shines light on regarding the flaws in our nation’s healthcare system and how “mental healthcare” is one of the faultiest systems of all. Foo walks the fine line between artful storytelling and researched informing. The most refreshing part of the book is that, for once, we’re hearing from someone who *isn’t* an “expert” or a PhD of psychology or someone who has the knowledge/academic background/clout and the prestige and power that comes with those things. Somehow, hearing the story of someone who went through hell, survived, and not only lived to tell the tale, but relentlessly pursued her own healing and never gave up, was far more impactful for me than all the “data,” “research,” and “studies” of experts.This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to heal, does not want to be a victim of their circumstances, and meets their past with curiosity. Highly recommend.',\n",
       "   'Well, I guess once I’m done crying I can explain how much this book meant to me. I stayed up until 4 am last night willing myself to put it down, but I knew I couldn’t. It’s a wonderful, horrible, sad, joyful journey into and through trauma. It resonated for me more than the many technical manuals I’ve read because Stephanie shared her personal story, her own journey, and her desperate need for understanding and healing, and it became intimately familiar and relatable, and empowering. Honestly, it was the perfect book for me at exactly the right time. I’m bouncing around on the same recovery boat, and it was a beautiful reminder that we can (and should strive to) paddle fiercely until we recover our true selves after complex trauma.I don’t know…I’m a trauma-informed therapist and a part of me wants to address the book from this professional aspect, but honestly? As a complex trauma survivor I just want to sit and feel good about Stephanie’s story. I want to enjoy how seen and heard it made me feel to read it. I want to bask in the delight of her discoveries and keep noticing how much us survivors all follow the same basic trail until we reach some level of enlightenment. I feel…good after reading this. I feel more aware of how trauma impacts specific communities, and I feel validated personally. Reading this gave me some peace.',\n",
       "   'This book was finally the book I needed about C-PTSD. I’ve read many other books about it, most of which were written by psychologists or other scientific professionals.

But by reading this book, I was given hope, strategies to use, statistics and information, and the motivation to keep fighting the “beast” she writes about.I would never wish the events that happen to cause C-PTSD on any human. But this author took the awful beast and is bringing so much good to the world, so the pain is not in vain.',\n",

       "  'reviews': ['Kiara, the narrator, is three months away from her eighteenth birthday and already dealing with grownup problems. She witnessed her dad wasting away from the illness that ultimately took him four years after he was released from prison, while her mother is doing time for an event the family never speaks of. Kiara is a high school dropout out of necessity, working a few hours a week at a local liquor store just to get by, while her older brother, Marcus, wastes his time dreaming of making it big as a rapper, like their uncle Ty.Just as the condominium they have lived in her entire life is being sold and the rent doubled, her part-time job hours are cut and she has no way to keep her head above water without help from her reluctant brother. To make matters worse, her ten-year-old neighbor, Trevor, has been deserted by his drug addict mother, and Kiara, having witnessed his birth and having known him all his life, feels responsible for his fate as well. Running out of options, it’s only a matter of time until Kiara starts to see her body as a way to keep them afloat, but even that option will have unforeseen consequences for her and those she holds dear.Gritty, equal parts anger-inducing and heartbreaking, it’s hard to believe that events like what this book depict may have happened in real life. Soaring prose and vividly rendered characters make Nightcrawling a triumph of storytelling. The Booker nomination was well-deserved.',\n",
       "   \"Nightcrawling is a poetic screed, a nightmare turned lullaby that will submerge you in the same feces filled swimming pool that sits like a monument – “… the way the chlorine and feces have become part of the air, the natural scent of the apartment.”It is a testament to place and time.“None of us have ever set foot in the pool for as long as I been here,” says 17-year-old Kiara, who along with her brother, Marcus, attempt to survive in Oakland. Abandoned by their mother, who attempted to kill herself after neglecting her infant daughter; the infant later found dead in that very pool. Their father died years earlier.Repulsed? Heard this before? Well, keep reading.Nightcrawling is a contemplation of what it means to be vulnerable, unprotected, and unseen, says the author, the 2018 Oakland Youth Poet Laureate, Leila Mottley, whose work has been featured in the New York Times and Oprah Daily. Nightcrawling\\xa0 is a 2022 Oprah’s Book Club pick and has also recently (announced July 26, 2022) been long-listed for the 2022 Booker Prize (the leading literary award in the English-speaking world), with 20-year Mottley, the youngest ever.Each sentence is a poem that wafts, delays, and immerses you in the mind of the novel’s heroine, Kiara.Nightcrawling exposes the trauma without becoming bogged down in it; at once, an element of hope amidst a seemingly endless string of roadblocks including family, long ago friends turned dizzying acquaintances, drugs, crime and prostitution.It is the familiar animus of our time.“Letting the streets have you is like planning your own funeral. Streets always find you in the daylight, when you least expect them to. Night crawling up to me when the sun’s out.”Kiara has to pay the rent but no one, other than the occasional side job, will hire her. Her slightly older brother Marcus tries but is too caught up in his own ego and pride and more importantly, the abandonment he feels from not only his mother and father but his ostensibly well to do Uncle Ty, who lives in LA, and has had success in the rap game.A game Marcus wants to give his all but his all is too little to ward off the lure of the street to which he inevitably succumbs.To Kiara, “Street money's still money,” and what begins as a misunderstanding grants Kiara a sense of power. A power\\xa0over men through the use of what she feels is the only thing she has left.“Only thing worse than a untamed man is a man on the edge of it.”In 2015, when Mottley was a young teenager in Oakland, a story broke describing how members of the Oakland Police Department, and several other police departments in the Bay Area, had participated in the sexual exploitation of a young woman and attempted to cover it up – author’s note.“I’m starting to think there is no such thing as a good cop, that the uniform erases the person inside it.”But\\xa0Nightcrawling is less about\\xa0cops than it is about humanity and degradation; the will to survive. Here, cops are simply the sledgehammer that keeps hammering even when there are no more holes to fill.“The swimming pool is filled with dog sh*t and Dee’s laughter mocks us at dawn.”But it is in the darkness brought to light, the true impact of Nightcrawling “that art is the way we imprint ourselves onto the world so there is no way to erase us.”\",\n",
       "   'At the age of 17, our main character Kiara is on her own. Father dead, mother in jail, older brother refusing to take any real responsibility. Playing stand-in mother to a neighbor\\'s kid, she carries the world on her shoulders as she tries to keep the apartment and survive. This is a story of desperation, of being pushed into a corner and how one bad decision can get you stuck in an untenable situation. Through her found family, Kiara finds a reason to keep going as well as (eventually) the support she needs to move on. \"Nightcrawling\" deals with so many issues -- poverty, abandonment, exploitation, racism, becoming an adult and resilience. No 17 year old should have all this on their shoulders. Mottley does an amazing job of creating a fully realized main character and showing how she navigates the situation and how she arrives at her decisions.This book is made even more interesting in retrospect knowing that it was inspired by a real case of police exploitation of a young black woman in Oakland, CA and the fact that Mottley, who is from Oakland, started writing this (her debut) novel when she was 16, with its publication when she was only 19. I look forward to reading more from this young woman who evidently is very talented.',\n",

I have read all that I can find about the civil rights movement and how black people had to navigate the white south after Reconstruction.  By Hands Now Known provides accounts of black men being mirdered by white law enforcement, bus drivers and others with impunity and with no legal consequences.  It’s difficult to understand the hatred and mistreatment that black people endured for the sake of segregation.  And the Federal Government standing by allowing black men, women and children in the south to be lynched indiscriminately, soldiers who fought for democracy in other countries and couldn’t find it at home.  I’m more enlightened about the suffering and pain that black people have endured for centuries in this nation.  And today who are we making America great again for?',\n",
       "   \"The book discusses the injustices and murderous horrors inflicted on Black people during the days of Jim Crow.  The violence was much more pervasive than is commonly known.  The book also discusses how the laws enacted during Reconstruction to protect Blacks were eviscerated or ignored.  Finally, the book discusses reparations, and specifically how the descendents of those directly affected by specific instances of violence, including murder, might be recompensed for the evils done to their families. I'd give five stars except that the book is unclear at the beginning as to just what the author's purpose is and because the discussions of crucial US Supreme Court cases are, overall, somewhat vague.\",\n",

       "   'Gives specific instances of the failure of law to address illegal murder of Blacks...rendering them invisible and destroying whole families.

       "   'Shows once again how the FEDERAL, STATE and LOCAL GOVERNMENT, had failed the black community by not protecting them. These book only hits a small percentage all the injustices people have to endure continuous to this day.',\n",
       "   'This is a difficult book to read.  Other recent books in what might be called the \"Critical Race Theory\" canon - \"The Sum of Us,\" \"Caste,\" or \"Devil in the Grove\" - are positively light reading compared to this one.  The book is organized a number of \"tentpoles\" of how Blacks were not really free, until very recently.  The best way I can summarize it is to say it provides some meat and bones to go with what have become memes, e.g. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, but how many people realize that for decades before that, Blacks had resisted segregation on buses, often paying with their lives.  Or the Great Migration is often portrayed as innocuous as the swallows returning to Capistrano, when it was for many a flight of refugees to relative safety when they had a target on their backs for, say, trying to register to vote.And it does a great job of getting one to understand how the federal government failed to protect Black people - soldiers posted to southern army bases who ran afoul of \"Southern Ways,\", or courts calling attacks on Black people a matter for the states and not a violation of constitutional rights.  We read about a number of Supreme Court rulines that make one understand the Plessy v. Ferguson or Korematsu weren\\'t the only dreadful decisions from that body.It\\'s dense and difficult, and unfortunately the writer hasn\\'t made the podcast rounds, but this book deserves a lot more attention.  And inclusion on a lot of history class reading lists.']},\n",

Audrey Hepburn is her go-to movie star.  She decides to go to Rome like Audrey did in Roman Holiday, but Italy is too far, so she goes to Rome, Kentucky.  Her car breaks down on the outskirts of town.  A man knocks on her window, but she will not unwind the window or get out of her car.  He gets frustrated and walks back to his house where her car is parked on his front lawn.  Noah, the man, decides it is too hot for her to stay in her car, so he asks Mabel, his grandmother's friend, to vouch for his good character.  After talking to Mabel, Amelia gets out of the car and stays in Noah's extra room for the night, figuring she will get to the bed and breakfast in town the next morning.  She finds it will take two weeks to fix her car, so Noah reluctantly offers his spare room.  Both are attracted but know she will only temporarily be in town, so they make rules and build walls to keep from getting close.  Will it work?I enjoyed this book.  It was fun watching Amelia get under Noah's skin as she imitated him, discovered things about him, constantly chattering at him, and all the other little things she does.  Noah's been burned by an ex-fiancée.  He does not trust easily.  Even knowing she's only temporarily in his life, he still falls for her.  Amelia also falls for Noah.  She has been spoiled living the pop star life and knows little of how to take care of herself.  But with Noah, she knows she is safe.  I liked watching them set up their rules and walls and seeing them fall.  I liked the vulnerability each brings to their relationship.  Amelia learns a lot about herself while in Rome.  She starts to find the joy of music again as well as the comfort of safe people in her life.  Noah also learns about himself while trying not to fall in love.I loved the town and its people.  A bunch of gossips who have good hearts and protect those they see as theirs.  I loved Noah's sisters.  Each was different in personality, but each backed the others,  The characters were quirky.  They were fun.  They saw love when it hit their town.I look forward to reading more of this author's work.\",\n",
       "   'Overwhelmed by her career and obligations Amelia, aka Rae Rose to her adoring fans, decides to leave town and spend some time in a small town a few hours from her home in Nashville, but when her car breaks down in the middle of the night in what looks like a back road without cell service, she panics and start rethinking her whole strategy.  It’s then when she meets Noah, the grumpy man who will change her life.I had never read this author and this book was an amazing surprise.  Being an all-time fan of classic movies and having Roman Holiday high on my favorites list, I was wary of the plot at first as I’ve read huge flops claiming to be a take on the movie, but this time was the fabulous exception as Ms. Adams wrote a delightful, fun and heartfelt tale where a woman escaping from the crushing pressures of her life finds herself and love in the most unexpected place of all.The book is beautifully written and, while it was obviously inspired by the movie, keeps its originality and greatly respects the source.  It was refreshing to read a story that is fun, sweet and engaging from beginning to end and not a run of the mill book that starts as a rom-com and ends up as a soggy attempt at being funny.Noah Walker is the perfect book boyfriend, his sisters and the rest of the town a complete hoot and sweet, lost, misguided Amelia is a joy to read as she navigates the hardships of finding her voice and taking charge of her life.I truly loved reading When in Rome and will be looking up more books by the author soon.5 absolutely glorious stars',\n",
       "   'When In Rome by Sarah Adams⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5🔥/5This book was so good. I immediately fell in love with the characters and the setting. In the description of the small town, I felt as though it was a place I’d been before. Very light on the spice, but the romance is strong regardless. This story was sweet and light, the type to make you fall for happily ever after all over again. 💜Rae Rose is exhausted by the pressures of fame and the constant demand of her time. She decides to sneak away and find herself, when her car breaks down in Noah Walker’s yard. He’s not the Prince Charming you’d expect, but he has a sort of small town chivalry that no one can resist. He’s been burned by a passerby before, so will he be able to open his home and heart to opportunity again?',\n",
       "   \"Actual Rating: 4.5 stars!This was such a fun read and my current favorite out of Adams's books! I absolutely adored Amelia and related so much to her obsession with Audrey Hepburn. I spent my teenage years watching and rewatching Hepburn's movies. I found Amelia just as relatable and, honestly, reading this right before the Eras Tour starts (and comparing Amelia to a younger TSwift) just gave me all the feels.This book was the perfect balance of MC growth and romance and now I need to go read every single book from Sarah Adams's backlist before May when Annie and Will's book is published!\",\n",
       "   'Literally so wholesome cute and funny. An easy read that’s makes you giggle the whole time. Even though it’s cheesy as heck it’s cheesy in a good way. So much banter I loved it. 4 stars only because it’s not some literary masterpiece but it is a perfect rom com.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['Told from the perspective of multiple generations, at different times, of a family of women from Memphis. Here we meet Joan, Miriam, August, Hazel, and Della, as well as other characters that enrich, weave, and shape their lives. History is woven into these pages, along with different perspectives of times and situations. After all, what looks the same to a 10 year old and a 35 year old? Time also shifts things. What people experience and think, of past and present, as they grow older. What it means to be a black person, but especially a black woman, in the heart and heat of Memphis. What experiences will shape each of these strong, gifted black women?I genuinely can’t say enough about this book. It’s not overly long, but it is rich in everything. 30 pages in, I was laughing at some things, but I also knew I would be crying before long, and I was right. This is beautiful, and sad, and funny, and real. I loved the author mixing in bits of history as she told this story from all of these different angles. Even when you guess at what is going to happen, or what has already happened, it still grabs you by the heart when it does. The characters are human, flawed and wonderful. Learning as they go. Finding the beauty in the anger. If I could give this more stars, I would. I couldn’t put the book down, the plot and the author’s unique storytelling kept me riveted.In addition, this version has a poem for Gianna Floyd, a recipe, some background on the author and the book, and pages of wonderful thank yous. It also has questions for a discussion with your book club. I hope Tara M. Stringfellow publishes more books, she has a big fan in me.',\n",
       "   'This book is something special.  Yes, it has a lot of the things we white people know to be part of the black experience in this country, but nothing feels trite or repetitive about it.  It feels woven in a colorful, joyful, painful way that I’ve never quite seen.  A little like the poetry the author references in her afterwords.  And the poem at the end- read through that horrible obtrusion Amazon puts at the not-quite-end of books.  They cut off a lot of goo stuff by doing that.  It would be beautiful if they somehow did an illustrated version of this.',\n",
       "   'This book took me a long time to start...my own personal trauma. It was beyond worth it. I have now gifted this book to two other friends. It is definitely a must read.',\n",
       "   'A good story about different  generations of strong black women living in the south and raising their children',\n",
       "   'This novel is beautiful! Being from the Memphis area and reading the descriptions that are so elegant but true to life of Memphis and the Mid-South was refreshing. The story weaves a family tale of strong despite struggle, of warriors who hurt too, of family, the Black Family in America. I give it 5 Stars and will tell everyone I know to read it. Bravo Tara M. Stringfellow!!!! Bravo!!!!',\n",
       "   'Great characters and descriptions of life in the south through the eyes of strong black women. Great book. Pleas read',\n",
       "   \"Memphis is a great 1st novel by the author in a story that spans a 70-year time period. This  is a powerful saga of four women who survive through family secrets and the hardships of black love.  These women forge through impossible situations involving incest and domestic abuse. Nevertheless, I felt that the author did not deal with the damages and effects that abuse can have on the victim and the abuser.  The author's writing style is excellent and I was drawn into the story by her awesome symbolism and prose.  However I was sometimes thrown off by the jumping back and forth in time periods.  Although these women show perseverance at times it seems as if their emotions are stifled and the full story is not told.  Maybe she's leaning toward a second novel to give us a more in depth picture of the  main characters and the other 41 characters in the book.\",\n",
       "   'Wow, this book started off as a very slow read for me and sometimes difficult. Because it bounce between women age and time zones. But it has a powerful message and that message is black women have always been the backbone of this country, we are strong, we are resilience and fierce. To all the black man that may read this book if you got a strong black woman you can do anything, cherish her and love her. Ms Stringfellow  love your book and I love your writing.  I look forward to reading some more of your work. God bless']},\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"I loved this book - I'm a baby boomer musician and have been an avid RS reader since day 1. My musical tastes and political leanings have always been in sync with Wenner's - his writing about music, political and environmental causes has always been fantastic, so why would his autobiography be any different?I had imagined, I guess, that he knew the rich and famous, but he knew EVERYONE! If you want an adventure behind the scenes of a master chronicler of popular culture, you will love this book!\",\n",
       "   \"Jann Wenner...Narcissism: selfishness, involving a sense of entitlement, a lack of empathy, and a need for admiration. That sums up Jann's personality type, and the main take away from reading this book.The early days of Rolling Stone are fascinating, because the music that it covered was phenomenal, and transformed a generation - a unique stitch in time!But those days did not last forever, and Jann has no real second act in Rock & Roll to report on. So Wenner writes about Bruce, Bono and others that kissed his ass, and vice versa. And his privileged life, going corporate, missing his corporate jet, and sex life.Boring...it ain't no substitute for the early days for Rock & Roll and the musicians that gave it life - sometimes, sadly,  literally.  Sex, drugs, and Rock & Roll - hard to beat it - too bad, Jann didn't spend more time writing about the behind the scenes action instead of his vacations, motorcycles and self obsession with himself.\",\n",
       "   \"The Rolling Stone was the first national publication that spoke to my generation. It connected us. This book by it's founder is a journey through the music, politics, and people of those unique times.\",\n",
       "   'This is a great autobiography. Not only about the author, but also about the business he created. It was fascinating to find out the details about the magazine I grew up reading and the insights into the artists and issues it covered.',\n",
       "   \"Well written memoir by the founding editor of Rolling Stone magazine.  Wenner gives a brief bio of his childhood and college years, which are actually pertinent to his path as co-founder of RS,  which is widely considered the de facto journal of the hippie/Rock and Roll scene.The birth, growing pains, and maturing of the magazine is nicely woven into the zeitgeist of the 60's and into the 70s, 80s, and so on.  He talks about his interactions and friendships with people including Mick Jagger, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and other musicians and cultural figures (e.g., Timothy Leary) of the era.  He also spends quite a few pages on his interactions with Annie Leibovitz and Hunter S. Thompson, whose careers he helped establish.  His description of his first meeting with Thompson (p. 118-9) is hysterical.  Later he describes his (and the magazines) maturation and move to New York from San Francisco.  Along with the move came friendships with folks Like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Andy Warhol, Tom Wolfe.Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, the book at times (especially in the last half) gets a little disjointed and verbose. Wenner's ego seems to take over as he talks about vacations with famous people on his private jet, a cross country motorcycle trip, and other anecdotes that really don’t have much if anything to do with the magazine, music, investigative reporting or politics.  Of course if you hang around with people like Bill and Hillary Clinton, Jackie O., Bono, Mick, Richard Gere and others I guess you get to boast a bit.At 556 pages it takes some effort to get through the book but I found it worth the time.\",\n",
       "   \"As a professional musician I've been a reader of Rolling Stone since the late 1960s and this behind the scene look at the world of rock music through the experiences of its publisher is nothing short of amazing. From early days in San Fransisco through very recent times, Jann lays out the music scene and its influence on popular culture - and Rolling Stone's place smack in the middle of it all. He and others at the magazine realized early on that they could also be one of the voices of the huge cultural shift in the latter part of the 20th Century and the embraced that role with incisive political reporting, too. Werner is not afraid to catalog both mistakes and triumphs through the years from a deeply personal perspective. Sex, drugs and rock and roll are all here and much more. Although he drops story after story of personal contact with virtually every big name in rock music those stories are told in a matter of fact manner; no hero worship here! He makes no denial of his admiration for certain people in the world of modern American popular music but does a great job of humanizing them with insights about their professional and private personas without value judgements.The book is long and occasionally lags a bit but stick with it if you want to confirm or find out the truth behind the  inexorable ties between modern popular music and the monumental changes in American culture over the last half century. Highly, highly recommended!\",\n",
       "   \"I enjoyed reading this book about the bay area scene more than NYC and the musical haunts he visited.  He was well connected either by design or happenstance or both.  It reads almost like a diary with real observations and comments that unfortunately some editors take away from authors.  Some online critics fault Jann's writing but it's ok with me.  He has a voice and it's real, calculating, and strategic and....egoistical.  Some Rolling Stone magazines writers I didn't have on the radar and will be reading some mentioned in the book.  There's a rivalry and taunting between the Stones and Jann and it permeates through the book, same with other British bands. It's nuanced yet palpable.  I think he should write another book with more details and dish on others below the radar but it seems he mingled with those higher in the Rock and Roll food chain.\"]},\n",

       "   'TL/DR (side bar: why do people always put those at the bottom; shouldn\\'t they be at the top if you don\\'t want to read the whole thing? I digress): If you liked MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO SOMEONE, you\\'ll like EMOTIONAL INHERITANCE.Both books are written by therapists, both weave the therapist\\'s journey in the book, and both share patient journeys. But EMOTIONAL INHERITANCE focuses on the intergenerational trauma. And let me tell you, for my deep thinkers who love going down a good rabbit hole (hi, it\\'s me), this book is for you. Not everyone will go down hypothetical paths or rabbit holes with me but that\\'s why I hold those friends even nearer and dearer. (LOL) Exploring the intergenerational trauma, the cycles that thread their way through families is just.... so fascinating.The word I keep using to describe this book is *interesting* and while that feels like a bland description, I was SO INTERESTED. As a reader, obviously I love stories and everyone has a story. But then to explore their parents and THEIR stories (and thus, how that affected how they viewed the world, what they taught their children, etc) was so fascinating. And then THEIR parents. This book is split into three sections: grandparents, parents, ourselves. Whew-- it goes deep and I am so here for it.How many times do you hear someone say \"that\\'s a generational thing\"? It\\'s so true. Generations before us saw some tough stuff. Many of them were taught not to discuss things. Move on. \"Get over it.\" Since children emulate what they see, no wonder things get... complicated through generations.If you\\'re a nonfiction reader, don\\'t miss this one. It\\'s a thought provoking, compelling, quick read about intergenerational trauma and its effects. It\\'s voyeuristic in a self reflective way. Five bright shining stars!',\n",
       "   'The last chapter of the book is aptly called A Door Opens. That is the most one can expect from reading it: it may unlock a new curiosity or shift the foundation of your mind enough that you want to learn more. It is not a deep account of generational trauma. It does not have a lot of cited research in it. It does not give the reader anything tangible. Rather, it uses narratives, and those narratives may create a curiosity. If you go into it knowing this, I think it can be a good read. It could be good for someone early in their journey of healing their trauma because the stories may be the nudge your subconscious needs to point it in a direction for what to learn about next. And for someone further along the journey, the short stories are definitely interesting and intriguing and perhaps even a welcome change of pace from more academic reads.I did find it hard to not doubt some of the stories a bit. The further I read, the more my spidey senses tingled. It could be purely because it reads like fiction, and that is enough to make me question what\\'s reality. Was the author adjusting the stories to drive a point home? Or did they all pan out this way? There was a perfection to the narratives, of which there are a lot, and an intuitive part of me kept rearing its head. I found this feeling to be distracting toward the end.I think it\\'s also important to note that the author is not without controversy. If people know they had narcissistic parents or BPD parents, one should probably approach with caution. This author is notably known for promoting the idea of family \"reunification\" - which most modern professionals would agree only works when both parties are willing to be active participants in that process (and can be further traumatizing otherwise).']},\n",

It looks bad, sounds bad but did she really kill her husband? The book goes through what really happened and it's very gripping.Possible spoilers....Possible spoilers:...Review: The book was well written. I didn't catch a spelling error or a misplaced sentence. I found it to be very captivating even starting on the very first page. It definitely makes you curious and makes you think and guess what's going to happen. There were twists I didn't see coming (not to sound so cliche but it's true). Its truly a really good book. I was entranced. I honestly wanted to binge it but couldn't since I didn't have the time.I rated it a 4 because although well written and I loved it, some things I had issues with.📍First being: The language that was used that's supposed to Filipino?? I think..it wasnt translatable on my Kindle so I had NO CLUE what was truly said. In some parts, the author did translate some but not all. I felt a little lost and a little stupid. Hated that. 📍 Second being: As a reader, your being flashed back in the past and to the present day without warning. There wasn't a break in chapters or anything to say 10 years ago or five years ago etc. It catches you off guard  📍 Third being: It was said that Charles was unalived with lexi's ice skate. Ruby was to have to put on the skate and unalived Charles. How?? How can a woman in her thirties put on a teenagers ice skate??📍Fourth being: Toward the ending of the book: Zoe asks Elsie why Elsie lied to the police of the last time she shaw Jimmy. Zoe says it was Elsie who disabled the home system and wiped all the data. wait...HOW DID ZOE KNOW ABOUT THE DATA SWEEP? HOW DID ZOE KNOW THE SYSTEM WAS DISABLED?? The only people who knew about the erasing of the data was Elsie, Paris, and the new lawyer.📍 Fifth and last, Elsie said that after she unloved Jimmy with the razor she bleached it and put it back in the drawer.If that's true then how did Paris have it in her hand next to the tub ??? Remember, she was covered in blood and the detective commanded her to drop the weapon???Conclusion: It was a good book. It was enticing and decently written. I Loved it. It just had some issues. And some things didn't add up. That's the only mistake I found. It's a good book though and I'll probably reread it 😊\",\n",
       "   \"Things we do in the dark kept my interest from the first scene to the end.The main character is Paris Peralta.

Jimmy is also famous. He was part of a show that everyone remembers and recently he has come back from retirement to do a couple of comedy specials.Paris knows the situation is dire. Yet, it can be worse if they find out the truth of who she really is. Although, someone already knows and is blackmailing her.Ruby Reyes, the Ice Queen, is in prison in Canada.

       "   '4 1/2 stars.My first book by Jennifer Hillier was Little Secrets and I loved it. So I was excited for her new book, Things We Do in the Dark, and I am happy to report this book did not disappoint. This book was just as good as the previous book I read.Paris Peralta has been arrested for killing her husband. She was found in their bathroom, covered in blood holding a straight edge razor and her husband was dead in the bathtub behind her. Paris did not kill her husband, but it is not that she has been arrested that worries her, it is the fact that her husband was a famous comedian and his death, and her arrest is going to bring media attention to her, and Paris does not want anyone from her past to recognize her and destroy the new life she has worked hard to build for herself. Twenty-five years ago, Ruby Reyes was convicted of killing her married lover. Ruby knows who Paris is and after being released from prison early, she is threatening to expose Paris. Paris has no choice but to face her dark past.This story is told in a dual timeline. The first timeline is in the present and follows Paris as she tries to clear her name in the death of her husband, as well as trying to keep her past from being exposed. I liked Paris and hoped that she would be able to figure out a way to prove her innocence. I figured out pretty early on what were some of the secrets from her past she was running from. In this timeline we also get the POV of Drew Malcom. Drew is a journalist, who currently has a podcast called “Things We Do in the Dark” and he is currently doing a segment on Ruby Reyes. It is during his research for the podcast that Drew unintentionally uncovers the secrets that Paris is trying to hide.The second timeline was my favorite. This timeline is told from the POV of Ruby Reyes’ daughter Joey and takes place twenty-five years ago. In this timeline we follow Joey before and after her mother was convicted of murder. I loved Joey so much and had such sympathy for her. She had a very hard life. Her mother was abusive to her. She also suffered abuse from her mother’s many boyfriends, and once her mother was in prison and she went to live with her aunt, uncle and cousins, things did not get any better. I had tears in my eyes a few times while reading.There is so much I want to say about this book but cannot without spoiling things. I loved everything about it. Even though I figured out the connection between Paris and Joey, there were still a few twists that caught me off guard. Hillier did an amazing job of bringing this story and the characters to life. I highly recommend Things We Do in the Dark. Be forewarned though, this book is pretty graphic in the blood department, and it does deal with child abuse.']},\n",

But I jumped out of bed, ran to the front door, opened it, and exclaimed to one of the painters, \"Did you hear that the Golden State Killer was just arrested?!\"  His reply:  \"Who\\'s the Golden State Killer?\"I couldn\\'t believe it.I couldn\\'t believe that the GSK was finally caught.  But maybe more incredibly, I couldn\\'t believe that someone didn\\'t know who that was, especially in the area where I live, just above the Napa Valley.  I thought that everyone knew about the Visalia Ransacker (VR) who morphed into the East Area Rapist (EAR) who then became the Original Night Stalker (ONS) whose nickname was finally wrapped up into the Golden State Killer (GSK) by Michelle McNamara.  She was in the middle of writing a book not long before his capture, from memory.  Unfortunately, she didn\\'t live long enough to finish it but lucky for us true-crime aficionados her book \"I\\'ll be Gone in the Dark\" (IGD) was finalized and published, supposedly by some of her assistants.  And I can attest to the fact that IGD is a very good read as I bought, downloaded, and read it myself.But then again, I\\'ve read many books about the GSK.  \"Killers Keep Secrets\" (KKS) which is an interesting book written (from memory) by the ex-brother-in-law of JJD.  \"The Case of the Golden State Killer\" (CGSK) which is a slightly unpolished effort but nonetheless informative read about the case where you will learn information probably not found anywhere else.  \"Hunting a Psychopath\" (HAP) which is an oddly humorous look at the case written by one of the original detectives on the EAR case, Richard Shelby.  I\\'ve even taken on a couple others which I found nearly unreadable.  But of course now I\\'ve just read \"Unmasked:  My Life Solving America\\'s Cold Cases\" (UNMASKED) which might be the most interesting of them all, mostly because it is written by the CSI-slash-DNA Expert-slash-detective Paul Holes, maybe the most important person in the case as he finally solved it around 45 years after it all started.  But of course a big assist goes to Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who helped Mr. Holes with research and building family trees for the case.Now, the GSK case isn\\'t the only one included in \"Unmasked:  My Life Solving America\\'s Cold Cases\" as the title implies.  Mr. Holes returns periodically throughout the book to discuss his progress on the GSK case, intermingled with other cases he worked alongside stories about his own personal life as well.  Some of that life Mr. Holes seems to be very happy about -- investigating and solving cases is his \"purpose on Earth\" to risk misquoting him -- and some of that life Mr. Holes seems to be not always proud of -- perhaps how chasing serial killers and other bad guys had detrimental effects on his family.And I\\'m assuming that Mr. Holes has had three of them.  Families, that is.  His original family included his parents and siblings.  Then he was married in his mid-twenties and started having children of his own perhaps before he was really ready, as he even admits.  Then he was divorced and was married again to his second wife and then had a couple more kids.  Mr. Holes has had at least four more children than I have but I still am able to empathize with him as he tells his story about feeling guilt, guilt that maybe he wasn\\'t there enough for those children.  But if you take my strong recommendation to buy and read UNMASKED you can read about that yourself.I just watched an interview this week -- the week of April 28, 2022 -- with Mr. Holes where the interviewer actually brings up the fact that he discusses a lot of his private life in the book.  I would say that usually, most true-crime \"fans\" -- fans of the genre and not fans of the crimes themselves, of course -- aren\\'t really much interested in \"personal stuff.\"  They want to read about the crime!  And they want to read about how the detectives investigated the crime!  And they want to read about how the UNSUB became the suspect who became the Number One Suspect who became a convict sitting in an 8 x 10 cell so he can realize why committing that crime was such a bad idea in the first place!  That kind of stuff.  But to me I actually like the parts in the book where Mr. Holes discusses his private life.  I was a fan of his television show -- \"The DNA of Murder with Paul Holes\" -- even though each episode didn\\'t necessarily have a tidy conclusion, and I actually wanted to know more about him, and not just his investigations.  It was just that he seems like a nice guy and so I was interested to learn how he became that nice guy.  It\\'s either that or he does one heck of a job faking it.  But I\\'m so rarely \"accused\" of being a nice guy myself I found it interesting to see how someone else can pull it off.  Ahem.In reality this review could become a book in and of itself if I wrote about everything that I liked, disliked, or maybe was simply neutral about.  Instead I\\'ll keep it short and just create a bulleted list of highlights or interesting points, at least for me, in no particular order:1.  I thought it was interesting that Mr. Holes and his family, after he retired, moved to the same town where Joe Kenda had been a detective, and Mr. Kenda had moved out of that same town when he retired. (I guess maybe detectives find it necessary to \"Get out of Dodge.\")2.  There is a show called \"Real Detective\" on the Investigation Discovery (ID) Network that I really like.  Season 2, Episode 1, entitled \"Blood Brothers\" is a must see.  John Conaty, a friend of Mr. Holes, is heavily featured during that episode.  At any rate the story in that episode is included in UNMASKED.3.  I really like the fact that Mr. Holes uses the first-person \"I\" throughout.  I do it myself in reviews, usually to alert the reader that what I\\'m writing is my opinion.4.  Believe it or not I got some really good laughs while reading.  One:  \"Guns don\\'t kill people, I kill people.\"  Everything is funny dependent upon context, I suppose.  Two:  \"Hurricane Holes.\"  Supposedly that was Mr. Holes\\' nickname given to him by his coworkers and I used it for comic relief in the title of this review.5.  The Jaycee Dugard case.  I read her book \"A Stolen Life\" -- I recommend it -- and I actually once drove past the house in Antioch where she was held for 18 years, mostly out of curiosity.  (I drove past JJD\\'s old house in Citrus Heights once too but THAT story is for another day as it is just too crazy to include here.)Well, if you\\'ve ever seen Paul Holes on TV you\\'ll probably think that he at least seems like a nice guy.  And that is true even though his coworkers gave him the nickname \"Hurricane Holes.\"  But how about changing that nickname to \"Hilarious Holes\" as he does have a way of periodically bringing some humor into an otherwise dark story.  But to finally wrap this up before I overstay my welcome, to Mr. Holes I will write, \"Enjoy your retirement!  You deserve it!\" although it seems he\\'s working harder nowadays than he ever has, what with his book and television deals alone.  But then I\\'d add, \"Thanks again for catching the Golden State Killer.  Even if that painter guy didn\\'t know who that was.\"',\n",
       "   'Paul Holes share a part of his soul in this book. I’ve only recently begun reading true crime but I’ve been listen to Paul Holes for years. If you love the podcasts he been on through the years you really should consider reading this book. If your intrigued by GSK then this book is a must read.',\n",
       "   'Not the book. Holes is a pretty fair writer and he had a helper. Bummer refers to the reality behind this famously handsome criminalist. When he went public after the capture of the Golden State Killer I actually sent an email cautioning him. I knew he would be inundated with female attention. I thought he should be protective of his marriage. Yes, even his male coworkers from a long time ago nicknamed him, \"Handsome \".So, why mention all this? Because it\\'s a stark, strange reality that exists for this man and for people who meet him and know basically nothing about him. Because, you see, behind the fine bone structure hides a haunted mind. Paul Holes is haunted to the point of self medictating with alcohol. He talks about it at length. No secret there.So here you will get fascinating explanations of how science tracked down killers. You will hear about stupid politics at the office. You will hear  about nightmares and panic attacks. About a wallflower personality. About what happens to a person who \" compartmentalizes\".You will find out that that handsome face hides indescribable horrors.A very good and frightening book.',\n",
       "   'My favorite read of 2023! Suspense, twists and turns, held me at the edge of my seat until the last chapter. Beautifully written and the vulnerability Hole shares around his work life balance is deeply felt. Would love to read a part 2 from this author!',\n",
       "   \"As a former USAF Special Agent doing criminal interrogations for over twenty five years, this book was difficult for me to put down even at bedtime.  I became immersed Holes' writing and could almost feel his emotions.  This was one great true life crime book.\",\n",
       "   'Very well written and easy to follow.  I heard the audio book wasn’t good so I got the hard back book and read it in a week.',\n",
       "   'I am halfway through this book and forcing myself to continue because it’s for a book club I want to join, but I absolutely do not understand why people love it. The author seems like a complete jerk. His attempts to justify his poor treatment of his first wife and kids as, “It was for the greater good of society,” fall flat. No, he was fascinated by the work and didn’t really give two rips about anyone else. I find his admissions about how much he ignored them were utterly self-serving. If I cared about anyone in his story, it was his first wife, Lori, whose plaintive, “I just don’t know what you want from me,” broke my heart. She was begging him to just once talk to her. And he just says, “Too late.” She was a way lovelier person than he could ever be, and I hope she is happy in her later marriage.As for the true crime aspect, most of the stories were highly superficial, which caused the reading of this book to be greatly prolonged as I invariably had to google each case to get more than skin deep insight. I’m less interested in the grim details than the motivation of the perpetrator(s) and task force personnel.Frankly, I am unsure why everyone loves this book? The author’s drive to solve the cases seems less to me of an act of compassion as repeated attempts to prove his own self worth when he, deep down, seems like a shallow, self-centered man. Perhaps I am mistaken, but reading this boring book that regurgitates therapy catch phrases about his deteriorated personal life, is at best 3 stars. I have just finished some phenomenal true crime books about Ted Bundy that were FAR superior.']},\n",

       "   'This is an excellent book for facts about officer POWs. I understand it is not great to be imprisoned. Yet, their conditions were far better than those of prisoners held at labor camps. In all my reading of people that hid in fear, worked to death at camps, starved to death, froze to death, these men were mostly bored, uncomfortable, and according to this book spent a lot of time inventing games, playing games, planning escapes, masturbating or turning to homosexuality. I never knew officers were held prisoners away from enlisted men or away from the Jews and other political prisoners.',\n",
       "   'Every chapter had something new and riveting.  I found myself reading extracts to my wife. The prison housed many who had escaped from other camps, but who were captured. The different nationalities competed to built escape tunnels of their own. This sometimes caused building problems or inadvertently caused the discovery other nationalities tunnels. Many RAF pilots were imprisoned there. Class strictures were maintained amongst the British. Donald Badar, the double amputee,  does not come across as the cheerful chappy as in the movie, Reach for the Sky, but as mean spirited and nasty. Many future dramatists got a start in prison dramatics. the author covers brilliantly a number escapes and attempted escapes. He details the great importance of Red Cross parcels and the trading that went on between prisoners and German guards. The anger and jealousy between ex RAF officers relating to TV program on the Escape from Colditz.  A great read.',\n",
       "   \"Though captured life for officers was gloomy, boring, limited, the unexpected heroic escapes, the creative replacement gadgets, and, the diverse panoply of unique characters, result in an absorbing eloquent kaleidoscope of a WWII prison.  Colditz is an impregnable medieval castle atop a hill detaining high risk Allied officers.  Fascinating fount of detailed information, especially the importance of Red Cross food parcels.  Swiss bureaucrats routinely inspected the POW facility pursuant to the 1929 Geneva Convention which was surprisingly rigorously adhered by the Germans.  Wing Commander Douglas Bader, the notorious double amputee fighter ace, was also an inmate.  Riveting, distressing, astounding -- man's inhumanity.\",\n",
       "   'I found myself getting confused sometimes but overall this is a good historical read. I had never heard of Colditz prison prior to reading this book so it was interesting to me in that regard.',\n",
       "   \"I thought this book was a great read. I learned quite a bit more about World War 2.  Truth is stranger than fiction. Certain parts of the book had me thinking about Hogan's Heroes and the Shawhank Redemption.  It was interesting to read all the background stories of the different prisoners and their determination and ingenuity.\",\n",
       "   \"Colditz Castle is an immense fortress in eastern Germany, for centuries a place of both refuge and imprisonment for a wide variety of inhabitants.  During World War II it became a holding pen for the most incorrigible trouble makers  as well as some of the most prominent or well-connected among the Allied prisoners.  Tales of what happened inside Colditz during those years began to spread even before the war ended, and in the eighty years since those stories have assumed the stuff of myths and legends.  Ben Macintyre has written a comprehensive history of the men who spent the war years inside Colditz, both as prisoners and as guards, that makes for an absolutely unput-downable read.When we read spy novels and memoirs or watch James Bond films we often find the tales of incredible escapes, intricate devices, and raw courage almost unbelievable.  Prisoners of the Castle has plenty of such tales that make anything Ian Fleming wrote seem tame in contrast.  As you read, you'll be overawed by the determination and character displayed by men like Airey Neave, Douglas Bader, Birendranath Mazumbar, Florimond Duke,  and Michael Sinclair, among many others.  You'll be just as impressed with many of the German officers like Reinhold Eggers, as well as with the multitude of others from outside Colditz who assisted the captives there, such as Irma Wernicke, Lee Carson, and Jane Walker.I'm always glad to see a new Ben Macintyre book on sale.  He always tells fascinating stories that are meticulously documented, filled with amazing anecdotes and incredible feats.  Prisoners of the Castle is one of his best works, ranking alongside Operation Mincemeat, Agent Zigzag, and Double Cross.  Buy it, but make sure you have plenty of reading time available, because you will not want to put Prisoners of the Castle down.\"]},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['“I think I am quite a different person, now,” he continued, eyes not leaving hers for a second, “for having met you and . . . I like who I am, who I have become, around you.” ~ Radcliffe ❤️So when I first began reading this novel, I was constantly comparing it to other media such as Bridgerton, on Netflix, because they had such similar plots. But once I stopped looking in that lens, I actually really enjoyed the story.Although I DID in fact enjoy this novel, it was very much predictable, and even when there were attempts at foreshadowing, it all kinda fell flat. I personally prefer more discrete foreshadowing, whereas in this case, it was as if it was slammed down on the page with a giant “LOOK HERE I’M IMPORTANT!” in big red letters. It was never simply implied for the reader to figure out amongst themselves, but stated rather matter-of-factly.All that aside, I would suggest this read to anyone who has that Bridgerton itch they just need to scratch. If you enjoy the regency era with all the splendor and amazement of cotillions and fancy dresses, with a touch of blackmail, this novel by Sophie Irwin is definitely for you.“Yes,” she confessed. “I will always choose my sisters. I will choose their need more than my want every day. But I want you just as much as I need money. You see me, in my entirety—the worst and the best of me—as no one else ever has.” ~ Kitty 💖',\n",
       "   'A wonderfully fun regency! The storyline is familiar but the story itself is fresh and well written. I love the witty, practical, and determined FMC, who was as honest as she needed to be for herself, was unable to bury her innate kindness, and was determined to live up to her responsibilities to her family.  I also enjoyed the slow burn romance between the main characters. Although it is an excellent first novel, I’m sad that the author does not have a back catalog for me to dive into now.',\n",

       "   'Great characters and a modern spin on ballrooms and romances of the past. Kitty is a heroine to admire for her honesty, loyalty and spunk.',\n",
       "   'Think of this book as something written by Julia Quinn but without the steamy sex scenes. It was well written, true to the period, and had delightfully witty repartee between the characters. The author has cleverly created a family comprised of five sisters, setting herself up for a series. I look forward to the next one.',\n",
       "   \"I picked this up without high expectations, but I have to say that it was refreshing. There wasn't any sex or cursing, no real violence or drugs. It was a really wholesome story at a time when there aren't many of these coming out. I'm not surprised that there is criticism because it's not the typical book being released in modern times. The story is fairly straightforward with some mild humor. It's an antiquated setting with a main character stuck at a time when women had few options. Some readers may hate that she is going to marry someone rich, but that's the main point of the book, after all.\",\n",
       "   'A Lady’s Guide to Fortune Hunting by Sophie Irwin is everything I fell in love with about reading and everything I want in historical romance. The humor is subtle. The dialogue is perfection. The oh-so-familiar storyline is freshly and deftly done.Ms. Irwin is a true ‘teller of tales.’ Her plot never slows and her characters never bore. She did her homework on Regency England, the balls, the gowns, ‘The Season’, and, most importantly, the levels of the societal norms of the times. The heroine who must find and snare a rich husband is anything but a stock character. The hero who sees right through her finds her conniving and distasteful until he sees his world through the lens of her circumstances.This is a story with heart and it stole mine! My only disappointment was knowing this was a debut novel and I can’t immediately dive into another by this author. But her name is on my list and you can be sure I’ll be waiting and watching and ready to click ‘buy now’!',\n",

       "   'A thoughtful guide on modeling conversations about race and racism for young kids, in recognition of the fact that they will be exposed to a lot of prejudiced situations and ideas that can be internalized if not actively confronted. This book definitely builds on author Ibram X. Kendi\\'s previous works like Stamped from the Beginning or especially How to Be an Antiracist, suggesting a framework in which individual actions either uphold or oppose bigotry -- with neutrality always defaulting to the former in a bigoted society like ours -- but I think it would still succeed for readers entering the curriculum here. (My advice for parents/caregivers might even be to start with this title, and only backtrack to those others if you find yourself resisting or confused by the writer\\'s definitions and assertions.)Some of the material can be a bit off-topic. The medical racism experienced by Kendi\\'s wife during her first pregnancy, for instance, although harrowing and illustrative of a widespread problem driving Black maternal mortality rates, doesn\\'t have much to do with raising children in an antiracist mindset. And there are a lot of passages that might be better suited for memoir, given how they reflect on moments in the author\\'s childhood when adults did not push back on racism that he was encountering then. But generally speaking, this is a valuable text for prompting proactive household discussions, featuring plenty of real-life examples to draw on and illustrating why a so-called \"colorblind\" approach of ignoring race and other human differences tends to reinforce bias rather than diminish it.[Content warning for gun violence, lynching, and racial slurs.]',\n",
       "   'How to Raise an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi is both an intensely personal memoir and a throughly researched explanation about the societal harms of racism and the importance of teaching antiracist values and actions to our children. Kendi’s writing is clear and compassionate and designed to leave parents, teachers, and caregivers feeling empowered and hopeful about their ability to engage in antiracist practices and teachings for the next generation.',\n",
       "   'How to Raise an Antiracist by Ibram X Kendi is a valuable book for anyone even remotely involved in a child\\'s life. The lessons here will have as much impact on the adults as on the children.I am in complete agreement with the idea that everyone is, in practice, either racist or antiracist. In other words, if all one says is \"I am not racist,\" even if they mean it, but does little to nothing to combat racism, then they are a de facto racist. If you don\\'t speak up when a friend says or does something, you are encouraging further racism, thus, in action, you are a racist, even if you disagree with what they said or did. One doesn\\'t define oneself by a negation, being \"not a racist\" might be descriptive but not much more. In a society in which race is built into so many aspects, one is either antiracist or, whether through inaction or actual intent, racist. That said, even someone who is antiracist can do or say racist things. The difference is usually one of awareness. An antiracist is less concerned with defending oneself than with improving, while the racist (including the \"I\\'m not racist\" variety) tries to rationalize or defend. We all have moments where we contribute to the racism in our society, to pretend otherwise is dangerous. It is what we choose to do when we realize what we are doing that makes a difference, both in ourselves and our society.All of that is to say that I found this book valuable in not just how I (should have) raised my children but also in how I can contribute to how others raise their children. The children in extended families and in communities are raised by everyone there, like it or not. We can make it easier on parents if we are also modeling antiracist behavior. Ideally we do so all the time no matter who is around, but we can make a point of being particularly vigilant when young people are around.If you\\'re worried about being preached to in this book, don\\'t be. Kendi passionately makes his points but does so as often by showing his own mistakes as pointing out the mistakes of others. The personal thread that runs throughout the book makes it almost memoirish at the same time that it allows the reader to feel less guilt about the mistakes in our past. We make mistakes, we can learn from them and improve or dwell on rationalizing them and contribute to racism. That choice is on you.I would highly recommend this to not only parents but anyone even remotely involved with young people.Reviewed from a copy made available by the publisher via NetGalley.']},\n",

The book reveals his reporting methodology and the many obstacles he faced during a difficult investigation into USC that ultimately also absorbed the LA Times and police departments from Pasadena to Huntington Beach. The engaging chapters show how he revealed multiple scandals at the University of Southern California. First, he documented the misdeeds of former USC School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito and his despicable, sick need to control  vulnerable young people with drugs and money. Further, Pringle and other LAT reporters uncovered the decades-long sexual abuse by USC gynecologist George Tyndall, and later, the bribe-for-admission operation dubbed Varsity Blues. USC paid $1 BILLION in damages for Tyndall, and the admissions scandal brought shame to USC and wealthy parents with unexceptional children.

The downfall was that the synopsis of the book didn't really match up with what was in the book. It sounds like this is going to be a crazy ride with ghosts and killer cartel groups. It is, but most of that doesn't happen until the end of the book. You have the nagging ghost but for most of the story, you learn about Rita and her family, flashing back to the past then coming into the present. Like I said, this was nicely done but not what I was wanting. Hopefully if Rita's story continues, we'll get more action and less backstory since we know all about her now.\",\n",

       "   'The novel, “Shutter” by Ramona Emerson, captured my interest from the first paragraph. The main character, Rita, of Navajo background, is a forensic photographer for the Albuquerque police department. Rita has another unique talent: she can see and communicate with the spirits of deceased people, be they friends or relatives, if they died naturally, in a car accident, or were killed violently. This ability has been both a blessing and a curse, mainly the latter. The story is told through the use of present time in one chapter, and the past in the next chapter. In the story, she is pursued by the ghosts of people who are seeking justice for being murdered. Most of the novel takes place in Albuquerque, Gallup, Tohatchie (a town on the Navajo reservation), and other towns in New Mexico; living in New Mexico, I certainly enjoyed reading about places I’m (somewhat) familiar with. I also enjoyed reading about aspects of Native and Hispanic culture, and how some elders from both the Native culture and Hispanic culture came together to pray in their respective ways to save the life of Rita when she was in danger. I also enjoyed the photography aspect: each chapter was given a title that referenced a particular camera, or a camera setting, and even computers. I truly enjoyed this novel.',\n",

Emily Henry has the knack to cater a book for a wide set of audience but somehow can make it personal to each and everyone of her readers, I believe everyone has something or the other within themselves that they can relate to her books with.Book Lovers felt like a witty, heartfelt love letter to life filled with hard to talk about emotions, day to day relationship struggles, familial bonds and deeply rooted anxiety that can stem out of loss and grief. There were moments I laughed so much that my insides were in stitches and then there were endearing moments that made me heart ache with joy, this once again is a very quotable book like her other books.It follows Nora, a literary agent who is a city girl through and through and holds life by it reigns trying to have everything under control. Nora\\'s character is a personification of a strong woman who wants everything and has the capability to take it,but what lies under that brave facade goes deeper than she could ever anticipate, her life revolves around her younger sister Libby to whom she is more of a mother than a sister. Nora\\'s fear of losing makes her overprotective at times so when Libby and Nora feel like they are drifting apart, they decide to go on a vacation to spend time together, a lot of things boils to the surface during their time in a small quaint town in North Carolina, which Nora will have to tackle head on. Nora\\'s character will be quite relatable to people who have hard time sorting their emotions and talking about them, I absolutely adored her character growthNora and Libby\\'s struggles and sibling rivalry is true to real life and complex because of the way they grew up and varying perspectives they have on life, I love how their relationship wasn\\'t turned into something hurtful or ugly. It was authentic and refreshing how their characters develop and how their love for each other changes them into better people, if you have a sister yourself I dare you not to cry while you read their beautiful relationshipThe unexpected twist Nora\\'s doesn\\'t anticipate while going on this \"trip of a lifetime\" is having to see the ever charming albeit snarky Charlie Lastra, her work nemesis which later ensues a fiery banter and sizzling chemistry between these two true enemies.Nora and Charlie\\'s banter is a chef\\'s kiss, they have so many witty word volley\\'s that will make you guffaw and make you forget that you are reading, my heart is so full while I read the precious moments between them.I also had to say this is probably the \"spiciest\" of all Emily Henry books could go on spice level with few open door scenes. Here is one of my favorite quote-\"Be my shark Stephens\". \"Already was\",I say. \"Always have been\".\"I love you\", he says again.\"I love you too\". I don\\'t have to force it past a knot or through the vise of a tight throat.Its simply the truth, and it breathes out of me, a wisp of smoke, a sigh, another floating blossom on a current carrying billions of them.\"I know\",he says. \"I can read you like a book\".What to expect-Heartfelt belly laughs as a result of witty/hilarious writing-A story of two siblings that tugs at your heart strings-A strong woman\\'s love letter to life in NYC- Endearing moments that will make your soul content-A beautiful love story between two characters who can be easily misunderstood- Deep discussions on big foot erotica ;)Do yourself a favor and get lost in this book!PS- That epilogue tho…TW- Anxiety, Death of a parent, grief',\n",
       "   'It has been awhile since a book moved me so completely that I was unable to find words to express myself, and instead, I just cracked open  and spilled tears all over my Kindle! Wow! Book Lovers by Emily Henry is that kind of a book. I was enthralled and catapulted from my reality into the world of Ms. Henry\\'s creation.This is the first book I have read of Emily Henry; I am not sure if my heart can take reading any others! I struggle to find the words that would explain the impact this book had on me. I found Nora and Charlie to be strangely relatable characters though they are different from me as night and day. Career driven, big city-lovers, should have nothing in common with an  old retired RN, who comfortably  settled in rural Missouri.  And yet, I was struck by how whole passages that Emily Henry penned were exactly what I would have said, if I could have found the words to put my thoughts into clear sentences. \"Killing me softly with his song...telling my whole life with his words...\" It was incredible, and terrifying at the same time.I can see why Book Lovers was on the Amazon Best of 2022 list. I can see why it was an editors pick. From page  one to the very last word I was spirited away from my real life and thrust into the world that Ms. Henry had created.  As Nora pointed out in this story, some books you don\\'t read, you live them, and that was certainly my reaction to Book Lovers. There are many parts of this book I have highlighted for future review. There are sentences and phrases I will go back and chew on, savoring the flavors and tastes that Emily\\'s clever word choices bring to mind. This is a book that I will bring out and read again and again, whenever I struggle to find the words I need to express my thoughts  aloud to someone! A classic of the time, Book Lovers is a book even those who hate romance genre will want to read.',\n",
       "   'This was my first Emily Henry book, and I will definitely be reading more of her novels! Book Lovers was an incredibly witty and sweet rom-com with a new take on some classic romance tropes.Nora Stephens is a New York literary agent who some call a “shark,” but really she’s just great at her job, works hard, and cares about her clients. Charlie Lastra is a New York editor who previously turned down Nora’s top client’s last novel. The two start as enemies, and since I love the enemies-to-lovers trope, this was perfect for me!Much of the book takes place in the somewhat idyllic/somewhat campy Sunshine Falls, North Carolina. I like that this setting was made to be beautiful but also at times slightly depressing, with a fun cast of characters and their quirky businesses.Although Nora and Charlie’s romance is unique, sweet, and slow-burny, with sooo much witty banter, my favorite relationship in this story was that of Nora and her younger sister Libby. The two experienced a major tragedy when they were a young adult and a teenager, and Nora has been trying to take care of Libby ever since (even though Libby is married and has two daughters with another on the way). This puts a strain on their relationship, especially when Nora seemingly puts her job before everything else. This story is all about how the two sisters come back together, share their secrets with each other, and discover an even tighter bond than the one they had when they were younger.If you want to grin, cry a little, laugh out loud, and be amazed by Ms. Henry’s cultural references (especially of the book variety), I highly recommend you read Book Lovers!']},\n",

I couldn’t put it down and have bought copies for friends too. I have lived in Mobile Alabama for more than 30 years.  When people mentioned Africatown, I would protest, thinking they were disparaging a black community north of downtown that was surrounded by heavy industry. I was astounded that a group of Africans who were brought here on a bet by a wealthy steamboat captain long after the importation of slaves had been outlawed had indeed formed the community and called it Africatown.  Ben has painstakingly researched the captains logs and historical documents to reconstruct the story. He went to Benin, Africa to see for himself where those people had been captured and sold. Then he searched the muddy delta and discovered the remains of the Clotilda, the last slave ship, that had been burned and sunk to hide evidence of the crime.Read and enjoy the story. You may be moved to come visit the “best new museum of 2023” to open later this year in Africatown, Mobile, Alabama.',\n",
       "   'In many ways, this book is amazing.  We get the background of Clotilda, the last slave ship to bring people from Africa for the purpose of enslavement in the US.  We read about the raid in Africa that captured the people, their journey across the Atlantic, and their life once in Alabama.  We see the establishment of their community post-Civil War and the growth of that community, along with following the people who came over on Clotilda.  The narrative continues with the development and eventual decay of Africa Town.  There’s discussion of how the actual shipwreck was discovered and the current state of affairs in the area of Africa where one of the major ports of the slave trade was.  The history is fascinating. I was drawn in emotionally.  The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that I struggled with the inclusion of some of the information (too much? relevance?) and I felt the flow of the narrative wasn’t smooth.',\n",

With this topic, many people feel strongly enough about the issue to say, \"No thanks,\" but Bloom gives us details that activate your empathy as you know Bloom\\'s anguish.Bloom provides a glimpse of the human experience that has a lot in common with regular, old-fashioned grief. You try to soak in the last moments and want your loved one around for selfish reasons, even though they no longer wish to suffer. The more I read the author in pain, the less my politics interfered or mattered.Alzheimer\\'s Disease has touched our lives in some form or another. Bloom reads directly from some of the manuals for caregivers to show precisely how different her reality is from those who try to oversimplify for support. For this reason, it baffles me that anyone would find a flaw in the book since, if anything, it made me value my time on this Earth more and reminded me why I would make a different choice in this situation but still understand Amy\\'s plight.Your feelings about this will coincide with your initial reaction to the end of \"Million Dollar Baby\" for reasons that would spoil a 19-year-old movie for some but will paint an all-too-familiar portrait of emotional trauma. Only the heartless would judge. Every decision at the end of the book causes stress, from the mundane to life and death. The scene at the casino shows how tough it is to rein in a patient with dementia when others encourage you to let them live.The journey to the end of the book is long and painful, but then again, so is Alzheimer\\'s. The text may not dispel your opinions, but it will show you that no one can or will enter this decision lightly or quickly. The cost eliminates 75% of the world\\'s population anyway. So accept this writing as one of the most human experiences you will read about this year.',\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed it on multiple levels.First, on content: Radke's research is well done. This is not an academic, peer reviewed piece of scholarship, but it is a well-researched, chronological and multi-disciplinary perspective on that part of our body we might often despise/regret/wish hidden/love/extoll/exhibit. Butts begins with an evolutionary explanation, a physiological treatise in what, why, and how we have butts at all and what they do for us. It then moves on into history proper, working to the present, and ending with a significant number of chapters focused on butts in the contemporary moment (Kim Kardashian and others) and in popular Western culture. [Radke is up front with the Western-centric focus of her study; this is a commentary on butts as understood in Western culture and history and is not a global study.]Second, prose: Radke's delivery is on point for a non-academic, general audience non-fiction. The prose is smooth, hilarious in so many parts, and remains lighthearted throughout, even when the content gets heavy and educational.Whatever you feelings and thoughts about butts, backsides, or bottoms, Butts is a great read.\"]},\n",

As he went through the growing years, mentioning crews and songs, memories came flooding back to me. This is a definitive chronicle of the building of what we know now as hip-hop culture. Johnathan Abrams seemingly spoke with everyone who was someone bringing this book alive. Hearing from some of hip-hop’s luminaries as they don the 20-20 lens of hindsight fills in some of the mysterious holes.

Some of those underground stories are brought to surface here.Thanks to the Crown publishing group and Netgalley for an advanced digital copy.',\n",
       "   \"How does an artistic movement begin. One person with an idea, a group of like minded people trying to entertain their friends, family, and others. People hopping on an idea to get them out of a place they know will probably keep them down or even kill them. Or as one person says in this book and I am paraphrasing, your brain is not the same as my brain, and we are not the same brain as this other guy, so what we can do with beats and samples will be totally different. That sounds as good a reason as any. The history of hip-hop has tons of stories about talent, musical and lyrical skills, breaks, helping some, dissing others, and a lot of using brains. Jonathan Abrams author and journalist has done his best to bring all their stories back to us in The Come Up: An Oral History of the Rise of Hip-Hop, in which players discuss the game from its beginnings up to the present day.The book covers over fifty year of history, starting in the block parties of New York City, expanding to the West Coast, and back to New York. Miami and the South are discussed as is the Mid-West. The book is a chronological history, but does move around a bit to get a sense of the scene and the people involved. The interviews share a theme discussing the ideas behind the block parties, the rise of the DJ and the scene, finding the beats to get the party started, and keep the people moving. The coming of MCs to hype up the people, evolving into rhymes and rhythms that started to get socially aware, as well as body moving. Disco influences, drum machines, West Coast sound, horror core, drill, trap. All with historical asides to tie-in events and movements that keep the narrative moving.The book is worth the hype. Most of my knowledge of hip-hop is of a person living in Connecticut watching on MTV and even I was amazed at what I remembered. The interviews are very good, informative, and when a story goes one way, Abrams finds another person, to go, hmm no this is what really happened. There are so many good stories, of people so just loving the music and getting behind it, helping each other out, sharing beats, rhymes, studio time, and supporting each other. Reading this one is amazed at how many lives were changed by hip-hop, some for good, but for others tragically. Abrams keeps the narrative going and describes, even to a neophyte like myself, the different sounds of different areas, and never loses track, or bogs down. With so large a cast that he interviewed I can't imagine that was easy, and I am quite impressed by all his work and how he arranged it. My favorite chapters are near the end, where the questions are more about creativity. People discussing filling journals with lines, or others just thinking about it in traffic, laying it down in the studio. Or just blasting back in rap battles right off the cuff. For so much talk about the evils of hip-hop that this kind of skill is just amazing to even think about, and I am in awe at their abilities on the mike, on the turntables, or in producing these songs.A book that needs a playlist. Readers will be on Spotify or checking out vinyl racks to see what secrets might be in their collections. This book is not just a history but a celebration of an American made form of music that could only have been created at a certain time, under certain conditions. Highly recommended for music fans, and cultural studies fans. This is a book that others will be compared to.\",\n",

       "   'I just finished Blakinger’s masterpiece.  And before life swept me along to my next mission, I stopped to write this review.  Keri Blakinger’s account of her descent into darkness and her rise out of it has left me with a cacophony of emotions that will take some time to sort out. I spent 2020 walking the deserted streets of Midtown Manhattan handing out sandwiches to the homeless people n our neighborhood.  I listened as they told me their stories.  What had led them to their fates.  All but one of the fifty men and women my husband and I befriended had spent time in prison. All were addicts.  I vaguely knew that prison was not a nice place to be.  And I knew the stories of some of the homeless women we met. What they had to do in prison. But I never “felt” the reality of what prison can do to a person until I read Keri’s book.  Bravo, Keri.  For your courage.  For your honesty.  For your strength of character.  And especially for the hope that you give to all of us.  Even in the midst of darkness, there is always a glimmer of hope.TMR, Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestselling author.',\n",
       "   'I read this book just after reading the Myth of Normal, which talks extensively about addiction being a coping mechanism for trauma. As I read about all the incarcerated women and the struggles they faced, that was all I could think about. These are traumatized women who never received the help and support they needed, and their lives spiraled a result. And of course, incarceration only adds to the trauma. The authors ability to overcome the challenges she faced is admirable, as is her ability to speak plainly and truthfully about the challenges she faced, and to acknowledge the privileges that nonetheless smoothed the path for her. Her work to bring to light the grave injustices of incarceration, and to aid those still inside, is inspiring. Highly recommend.',\n",

       "  'reviews': ['This book succeeds at being exactly what the author set out for it to be:  a light, fluffy novel to enjoy after a particularly stressful time in our recent history.  It works gloriously -- I had a blast reading this.  That said, I\\'ll agree with some of the observations of other reviewers that Jamie\\'s (he\\'s the viewpoint character) friends are not particularly developed.  But I think that is fine, because the whole purpose of a book like this is just to take the reader on a fun ride without getting overly bogged down in things like character development.  This book is the written equivalent of a fun adventure movie (and, in fact, I think it would adapt well to the screen), as opposed to the sort of deeply introspective things that win awards.So, a little background.  This novel starts at the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020 and is set during the pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.  In fact, it ends right after the election.  And while those things don\\'t dominate this book, they are an important aspect to the context of the novel -- because part of the fun of this book is the idea of being able to just disappear into another world for a few months and not have to deal with those things.  But without the pandemic, Jamie likely never would have even been in a position where he\\'d have been offered a job with the Kaiju Preservation Society.Aside from that, the premise is that the Kaiju (Japanese movie monsters) are real and that they exist on a parallel Earth.  The Kaiju Preservation Society sends people to this alternate Earth where they both study and care for these creatures.  And therein lies some of the appeal of the book and why the pandemic and presidential election matter to the success of this book.  After all, what science fiction reader doesn\\'t find the idea of having spent 2020 in an alternate world more than a bit appealing?  I don\\'t want to do any spoilers, so I\\'ll just note that while the first half of the book is primarily setting things up, there is some genuine action and adventure in the second half.The only other thing I\\'ll note is that if you\\'re one of those people who think that \"woke\" is awful and Trump is a great president, I suggest that you skip this book.  You won\\'t like it -- it contains a non-binary character and the author\\'s political leanings will annoy you -- and you\\'ll come back and unfairly malign this book.

It\\'s meant to be light and catchy, with three minutes of hooks and choruses for you to sing along with, and then you\\'re done and you go on with your day, hopefully with a smile on your face.\" That\\'s a pretty accurate description of KPS, which is an enormously entertaining, if slight, book about a government agency that oversees, studies, and yes, preserves a planet full of kaiju - massive monsters a la Godzilla, Mothra, and the like. (Kaiju is the Japanese name for the giant monster genre.) Told in Scalzi\\'s usual jokey, quippy style, KPS moves rapidly, delivers some amazing wonder, gives enough plot to get the job done, and moves on - much like the pop song he concedes the book to be. That\\'s both to its credit - the book is hugely fun, harbors no illusions about what it is, and delivers the entertainment is wants to do - and its detriment, as the villain is a bit heavy-handed, the plot a little obvious and unsurprising, and the world ultimately less explored than I wish it was. But as Scalzi says, \"we all need a pop song from time to time,\" and he\\'s not wrong - KPS was exactly what I needed after a few heavier books and some general stress in life. I maybe wish there was a little more heft to it, but as a fun bit of imaginative storytelling, it hit the spot nicely.',\n",

The hardback was published in 2022.  I am hoping that there will be sequels.Jamie Gray needed a new job after being fired by his boss, the CEO at füdmüd in New York City as the Covid-19 pandemic was starting.  So, he took the offered job of being a food deliverator for füdmüd out of desperation.  And months later, Jamie met an old acquaintance deliverating food to him, Tom.  Tom ends up offering Jamie a real job working with KPS, an animal rights organization.  The job is six months on site at a incredibly remote location working with very large animals.A fully mature Kaiju is 100 meters to 150 meters (300 feet to 450 feet) tall.  They have parasites inhabiting them that are incredibly dangerous and help them to live.  And, they violate the Square Cube Law with their power source.  And, they can fly.',\n",

I was entertained throughout and appreciate the world Scalzi paints describing how we and Kaiju might live together.

       "   \"After reading the description of this book I was hesitant to buy it.  But then I said to myself - this is a John Scalzi book.  So yeah, I bought it.  It is well-written as expected and held my interest throughout.  I especially liked the beginning which details how Jaime Gray lost his job during the Covid crisis and ended up working for the Kaiju Preservation Society.It is sort of a gritty feel-good book and decidedly a fun read.  Nonetheless I felt a bit disappointed because it lacked the scope and grandeur of his other books such as the Interdependency trilogy and the Old Man's War series.\"]},\n",

I did have an initial issue with the author's voice at first. The writing was gritty, and at times I was like, ‘what do you mean by that? is this English’? - The references were very urbanly specific. I didn't get the lingo. But I soon forgot about it and was swept along the spine-chilling plot. The characters too were beautiful and rich, the sweet little romance and the family dynamics were fresh and realistic. I loved the book so much I had to re-read the Hazel Wood, just to get another fix!!! I think Melissa Albert is exceptionally gifted at creating plot, atmosphere and captivating gritty characters - they were all gritty by the way…all had dirty hair and ate with their fingers and cursed…But hey...It was fine.

I like how the book was told across multiple time-lines, introducing you a little bit at a time to what you need to know in order to full experience the story. The mother-daughter relationship is marvelously drawn, and the more you understand about each character, the more you sympathize with both of them. Mysteries are drawn out in delicate layers so the whole novel is kind of filled with \"aha\" moments which raise more questions.I found this to be much more complex than the Hazelwood series, which is excellent. Even though the entwining stories are told from the perspective of young women, it doesn\\'t feel very young-adultish.I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and look forward to her next.',\n",

We learn about the advances we’ve made in interpreting the vocalizations of whales.The result is unexpectedly moving and profound. This book is a great read, especially paired with Ted Chiang’s short story “The Great Silence”.',\n",

Mustill uses an almost Hitchcockian narration – he starts by describing a near-death experience during whale-watching and then takes a reader on a mindblowing journey, both in geographic and intellectual terms. His curiosity, fueled by this unforgettable encounter, drives him to fascinating places and meetings with extraordinary people. While this is mainly a popular science book, it also blends in travelog, nature, and even tech writing. The first-person perspective works perfectly, engaging the reader, and the style is fresh and witty.I first read about this book in a New Yorker piece by Elizabeth Kolbert, in which she also wrote about the latest Ed Yong book, An Immense World – and I think that if you like both of those authors, you will love “How to Speak Whale” as well.Thanks to the publisher, Grand Central Publishing, and NetGalley for an advanced copy of this book.']},\n",

Well, for awhile we didn't hear much, but once Brandon put the word out that a book was coming, we were like seriously waiting on this. I'm not surprised it's a bestseller. I'm also convinced that there's a couple more books in Tanqueray. I'm hoping. But I am glad she's getting her day in the sun because she so richly deserves it. Now, onto the story. She was born in Albany. She and Mom didn't get along, who had a job as an Assistant for the Governor of New York himself. She got pregnant young and was promised a marriage, but dude was already married. so she figures to go back and get her clothes at her moms, she doesnt go through the front door, but gets in, gets busted by dear old Mom, who called 5-0 on her. She had a choice of jail or Mom. Would ya believe, she chose jail. After doing her time,( even though her mom screws the head of the parole board to keep her in, though the warden gave him the slip,she ended up in NYC and became one of the top burlesque girls in Manhattan during the 60s and 70s. She does some name dropping but refuses to divulge the name of the President who came to NYC to be with one of her friends from time to time. She also has a talent for sewing, so sister kept that up. Highly recommend the book but I also advise, she got colorful language, so don't come if that's not your cup of tea. Also check out the words on the front cover. I have since bought the book for a friend on her birthday. We'll see how that go. More more more 9/19/22. Critique. I've been looking forward to MS Tanq's book. and it didn't take long for me to read it. I read it within a setting. I expected more more more, but I get it, you don't mind attention, but not all.

There were moments when I struggled to believe this was all real, but that’s a form of self-protection. Her story isn’t at all typical, from beginning to end, but details aside, her ability to survive is an important thing to know. Things that shatter you don’t always have the last word.

Her mother was a hoarder and there was literally not enough room for Nietfled to sleep in the house. Throughout it all, Nietfeld clung to her dreams of going to college. Her studies pulled her forward and she ended up getting an \"acceptance\" to Harvard.This memoir really got me thinking about love despite dysfunction and/or dysfunction despite love. Her relationship with both her mother and father was complicated to say the least. We see Nietfeld\\'s inner strength, her work ethic, and her missteps, as well. We are reminded in these pages that acceptance is a multifaceted concept involving both forces outside ourselves and forces from within. This story is riveting, painful, and inspiring. I highly recommend.',\n",
       "   'This is a raw, honest, and hard-hitting memoir about what it means to be up against forces beyond one\\'s control, especially as a young person living in a world governed by messy, contradictory adults. Nietfeld is adroit at capturing her early rage at the challenges she faced living with a hoarder mother who sought to \"fix\" things by seeking psychiatric help for her daughter and then later denying the seriousness of the abuses that daughter experienced within the foster care system and beyond. The memoir\\'s structure felt as complex as Nietfeld\\'s life, giving us both a wider view of that life while homing in on specific sections of it to explore them in detail, a structure that I thought did the subject matter justice. The memoir gripped me throughout with Nietfeld\\'s direct voice and compelling narrative. As an educator myself, I especially appreciated how well it captured the anxiety felt by many high school seniors, who so often feel as though they must figure out their entire lives at the age of eighteen, yet another absurd demand we place on our young people. This memoir is a truly incredible testament to what it means to try to survive in a world that applauds our survival while simultaneously making that survival feel impossible.',\n",

       "   'There’s a sub-genre of memoirs, increasingly common, about people with limited means and lifetimes of trauma making it to college. Far too often a simplistic, grit-focused rags to riches story is told, one that doesn’t challenge the American Dream nonsense at all and just makes the middle class reader feel… satisfied.This is not that book. It may feel like it is at first- the opening pages of this book aren’t nearly as good as those at the end. But Emi is offering angles and nuanced and insights entirely her own- and she’s clearly done the work to understand her life and then observe it from afar.  The result is an engrossing and powerful book that I hope every high school and college student will read- especially those who think highly rejective colleges are the end all be all. Or who think that college is an escape from family and the only key to freedom.I’m truly grateful for this book. I’ll never forget it.',\n",

Reading \"Acceptance\" instantly brought back the memories I had of Emi over the years, and I wished I would have gotten to know her better and supported her in more ways. It\\'s a great reminder that so many families hide what\\'s truly going on at home, and many children are in so much pain. This book is raw and real, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a true story of resilience and overcoming and the odds.',\n",

London and Drew were high school classmates and she didn't get along with him during that time. They meet up again after 15 years at their class reunion and end up having a one night stand or so they thought. Since Drew is doing a job for the hospital that London works at, he is sticking around for a while. Despite London saying it's a one time thing, they can't keep their hands to themselves. I really enjoyed how Ms. Rochon told this story. I loved how London was able to discover who she truly is and learn to accept love from Drew. This is a true enemies to lovers story which ended up being a soul-searching romance for both Drew and London. I highly recommend this book and suggest that you pick up a copy of this book.\",\n",

Drew is perfection and I love everything about his character. I wouldn’t necessarily categorize the story as enemy to lovers (it depends on how enemy-ish you like your enemies to be). More like rivals to lovers. None of the less, loved their relationship and banter from start to finish.',\n",

The author, Farrah Rochon, touched on several important elements like disrespectful treatment of wo.en in the work place and society, lack of proper self-care and low self-esteem, disfunctional family relationships, as well as inadequate funding for health facilities in low income neighborhoods and rural communities. This book brought so many emotions to the surface, causing me to reevaluate how I view my time the people I allow into my head/ hart space. It would be nice to get a short book showing where each of these ladies and their men are 5 years from now.\",\n",

The enemies to lovers troupe never gets old to me, and MS. Rochon didn\\'t disappoint with this one. The struggle that London faced within herself instead if with Drew was on point. And I love how the major \"conflict\",  if you will, wasn\\'t so much between the two main characters, but with their lives and the people in it......There love story was about as sweet , real, and honest as it gets...and I was here for it!!! Drew wore London down so effortlessly, and London fell so hard before she ever realized what was happening to her!

Her life seems to be going well until she runs into her high school nemesis, Drew Sullivan, at their high school reunion. After 15 years, she is still sore at having to share the valedictorian slot with him. And does he have to be so hot and so successful?A one-time bootie call turns farce as she finds to her dismay that Drew is in charge of the audit of the hospital she works for, an audit which will determine if the hospital should be sold or not.  If there had been residual tension from high school, it ratchets up a few notches from this.  She's understandably angry, feeling betrayed, and yet still attracted to him.  She is also dealing with family issues and trying to decide her career path as she is being courted by other hospitals for fellowships at the close of her residency.London is the last of the three friends in The Boyfriend Project to get her own story and match.  She is brilliant and sassy and caring and I was pleased to see her find a man who is her equal.

The unexpected death of her Mom who was her biggest fan brought Greta to her knees at a concert that put her career on hold. During this time, she decides to go on an Alaskan cruise that her Mom had booked for her 40th wedding anniversary before she died. Greta didn't want her Dad and four of his friends to go without a partner so she went. This trip was the healing Greta and her Dad needed to get over their grief and the battle they always had over Greta's career choice. She also meets Ben who is separated from his wife and two children. When a medical emergency happens with one of his daughters, he leaves the cruise early to go back to his family. They remain distant friends and the way the book ends, there is hope that they might meet again. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy books about overcoming life struggles.

       "   'Ultimately, I did like this book. The complicated feelings I have ended with me enjoying it, so I’m giving it 4 stars. But there were moments where it was touch and go.First, the rift between Greta and her dad is 100% his fault and the hurt feelings he gets are because he deserved them. Just because his wife died doesn’t mean he suddenly wasn’t awful for 20 years to his daughter. Don’t try to make it about both of them being wrong.Second, the love interest is a famous author who wrote a fictional biography of Jack London (because Hemingway would have been too on the nose) and I swear for a guy so excited about research, he seems to have only scanned Wikipedia in his knowledge of the actual Jack London. He makes bad dad jokes and legit carries an emergency copy of Call of the Wild, so I didn’t completely hate him, but again, it was touch and go.And the end of it all, it didn’t really matter. It made me feel things, I cried. It was stupid. And it didn’t betray its heroine the way I thought it would, so that’s something.',\n",

Our \"hero\" detective has the skills to do the job, but he begins to understand how he has not really been a hero to the people that should and, as he realizes throughout the storyline, do matter to him. Any stereotyped characters were, unfortunately, not really stereotypes at all. CIS bullies are still too prevalent today. The plot moved along nicely.  The steps to the murder solution built well upon each other. The more I read, the more I appreciated the humanity and grace of the Lavender House family. This would be a good book for a book club, there are many avenues of discussion...the definition of family, how history has treated gay & lesbians, how literature has portrayed them, how we treat/appreciate the people in our lives, and if you are comfortable with the actions of Pearl at the end of the story.  And I really liked the ending.',\n",
       "   \"Lavender House was one of my favorite books of 2022. The story was complex and the characters were complicated. The story has characteristics of class Noirs like Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. Take one man down on his luck. He is so down that his next planned step is off the Golden Gate Bridge. Put that man is a house with astounding characters, each with their own agenda, where one of them is a murderer. A house that is far removed from any neighbors. Stir in a little corporate rivalry. Now that man needs to solve the murder against the wishes of a few of the characters. He also needs to stay alive.Vikas Adam's narration was marvelous. In fact, I bought the audiobook of The Far Pavilions simply because he was narrating it. The voice of the main character is rough and his emotions come through clearly. The other members of the household, whether male or female, young or old, are all very well done.I was quickly immersed in the story. The mystery was fun to try to solve. I did not. Lavender House left me wanting more, especially from the main character Andy. The 1950s time period with a queer private detective written by Lev AC Rosen would be an automatic buy.\\u200bI received a copy of the audiobook from Netgalley and then won one from Macmillian Audio through an Instagram post.

       "  'reviews': ['George Floyd’s story is a tragedy, and his death has become iconic, a marker of our times. In an age of limitless videos, the images of his final moments have been seen by millions.The book by Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa is a complete account of Floyd’s life and how he met his untimely end. The title, “His Name is George Floyd”, is taken from the chant activists shouted in the massive protests following his death. Subtitled “One Man’s Life and The Struggle for Racial Justice”, the book is much more than a biography.The first words in the book are “I love you”, a phrase Floyd often spoke before parting from family or friends. Floyd was a loving person throughout his life and when confined along with millions by the Covid lockdown, he made frequent calls to connect with those close to him. Expressions of love continued to the very end of his life where “Floyd repeatedly found his dreams diminished, deferred, and derailed – in no small part because of the color of his skin.”This is the premise of the book, that being Black was the main determinant in Floyd’s life. Guided by this theme, the authors tell of Floyd’s forty-six years leading up to the “nine minutes and 29 seconds he spent gasping for air”, as he died and of the “historic movement for civil rights that followed.”The authors’ stated hope was to put Floyd in context with his world, “never absolving him of responsibility or making excuses for his actions.” This is key because on his final day Floyd was “smoking weed, snorting powdered fentanyl and taking Tylenol.” The book covers at length the external forces affecting Floyd, from the legacy of slavery to his life as a Black man in America.The book is comprehensive, giving the history of racial disparities in both Houston, where Floyd grew up, and of Minneapolis, where he died. The authors delve into the ancestry of major players, especially contrasting Floyd’s roots with those of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who killed him. The resulting portrait is painted as “white privilege” enjoyed by Chauvin’s ancestors as opposed to the oppression experienced by Floyd’s forebears.While the book lists multiple reasons for Floyd’s downward trajectory, a single sentence about his final year in high school is key. “Like Floyd, many of the young men had grown up without fathers.” This factor has proven to be the single greatest influence on a youngster’s life.But the book looks elsewhere for explanations, making a catalogue of atrocities committed against Blacks since emancipation. After what seems like an endless stream of negativity, a positive story emerges, surprisingly just before he dies, centered on Floyd’s longstanding belief that God was watching over him.In Texas after his mother’s death in 2018, he, a girlfriend and her uncle were on an impromptu road trip between Houston and Louisiana late at night when they ran out of gas. Driving his car, Floyd was to blame, but tried to calm his friend, saying, “God’s got us.” As he and the uncle tried to push the car, a loud pickup appeared from the darkness, pulling over in front of them and “the most redneck-looking White guy” got out. The girlfriend became fearful, recalling the racist killing of James Byrd, dragged to death from a pickup twenty years earlier in the same area. But Floyd had no qualms, walking up to the stranger, shaking hands, saying they’d run out of gas. The young man was sympathetic, arranging to tow them to a gas station and putting $15 of fuel in their car so they could be on their way. The pleasant memory breaks to the grim present when Floyd speaks his last words.While the book is a solid biography, it is a flawed as history, steeped in the political divisions of the present. The book would serve well as an addendum to the 1619 Project.',\n",
       "   '“His Name is George Floyd” is a detailed and unvarnished account of George Floyd’s life, death, and aftermath.George’s personal story illustrates how both the good and the bad intertwine in the lives of so many Americans. The biographical sections (parts I and II) are passionate, dramatic, page-turners. George’s achievements, humility, resilience, and dedication to personal relationships exhibits the great potential of humanity. Simultaneously, George’s challenges (lack of role models, failing schools, police harassment and brutality) and life’s temptations (crime, drugs, sex) often lead to profound and predictable tragedy. Ultimately, whether you find his story hopeful or fatalistic, heroic or wretched will hinge on your interpretation of the balance between these forces. And on the extent to which you believe our society is learning the correct lessons from George’s existence and demise.“HIs Name…” is a biography—not a policy book. Yet, this history will inform opinions and policy conversations on both sides of the aisle regarding a host of important issues: education, policing, drugs. Expectedly, the authors have their own policy preferences. Many are predictable: increased funding for schools, better police training. But several analyses are pleasantly surprising: a wink towards licensure deregulation, an explanation of unintended ill-effects from school de-segregation. Inevitably, the sources and the authors both influence the omissions and inclusions, as well as their framing. For instance, there is a lengthy discussion about the challenges of establishing a career as a convicted felon, but only passing reference to George seeking legal employment before the age of 33. I was left wondering to what extent George pursued options other than crime at a young age and what roadblocks he may have encountered in such a pursuit. Overall, the factual history comes through clearly and is surprisingly comprehensive. “His name…” provides a common basis, albeit anecdotal, for policy conversations and debates worth engaging in.',\n",

       "   \"We all think we know George Floyd, as his life and missteps got bandied about in the news, and in our conversations in the aftermath of his death.  This book is an in depth portrait of the man behind the icon: imperfect, kind, rarely at home in his body or space, creative, deeply human, loved.It also reads like a case study on the American experience where structural racism, the aftereffects on the War on Drugs and the War on Poverty worked on the Floyd family and on Big Floyd's existence.  Will be pressing this into the hands of everyone I know.  Even if you think you know the story, I guarantee there are parts of this book that will take you by surprise, and cause you to reckon with our history and present.\",\n",
       "   \"A sad true-life story of our times. A well written book that puts George's life into perspective. The catch, of course, is what should each of us (including all the other Georges) do to reduce the odds of more such tragedies.\",\n",
       "   'The authors give a balanced portrait of Floyd. It reinforced my suspicion that for some racial groups life chances are still different. Like gambling in casinos the house, Whites, always wins. The reader is left with hope but the impression America has a long way to go to have justice and inequality curbed. The writers deserve credit for excellent writing of a compelling story.']},\n",

       "   'Drums. Music. Struggles. Heartache. Recovery. Self-improvement. Drugs & Rehab. Racial Oppression. Racial & Social Justice. Gender & Sexuality differences as the norm. The Final Strife: A Novel has it all and more. This is the first book in a couple of decade that I literally could not put down and I constantly crave reading more in this series. Saara El-Arifi has created a cast of characters and followed them through a harrowing journey that would challenge even the best of character who do not possess the strength and courage to fight for not only their own lives, but the lives of every other oppressed individual as well.Many, many happy congratulation to Saara El-Arifi on their debut novel and I eagerly await more books in this series. And Saara, if you happen to see this, I know that you only have this planned for a trilogy, but I would excitedly read as many books in this series as you would favor us to write.',\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"Danielle Prescott reveals much as she shares her own experiences with beauty and fashion as a black woman, speaking as someone coming from the fashion industry. Beginning with her childhood, she walks her readers through the encounters that shaped her ideas about being beautiful - from hairstyles to weight loss to wardrobe and everything in between. She is ruthless in exposing how she was her harshest critic, ultimately leading to an unhealthy lifestyle to maintain beauty standards she never should have had to pursue. She stops short of naming names (for the most part), but she calls out magazines, design houses, and other players in the industry who have perpetuated the idea that beauty means being tall, blonde, and unrealistically skinny.Prescod gives an honest account of when she didn't, and when she did, stand up for minorities, particularly black women, once she held positions of influence in various companies. Her revelations shouldn't be earth-shattering to anyone, and yet I suspect they will be. They are certainly uncomfortable at the least and horrifying in many cases, even while they ring true. I admire her willingness to speak out and to share her journey towards self-acceptance and healing. We all have the power to change things - even if it's just changing ourselves and how we treat and view others. Reading about the authors' experiences should make us want to try to make things better - to accept that we are all different and one kind of different isn't better than another when it comes to physical attributes.I don't write this review pretending to be an expert or to say that I understand what Danielle Prescod suffered, only to praise her efforts at raising awareness and show my admiration for her honesty and perspective, and my hopes that I've learned from her memoir and can take some small action to help change for the better.\",\n",
       "   \"This book made me glad I didn't grow up rich. I can relate to someone trying to make me feel stupid when, as a new hire someone else made a mistake for which I was automatically blamed by the female supervisor. My schools were mostly white. I attended a big city high school as a freshman where there were Blacks, Armenians, and other ethnicities.  Idon't remember any mean girls or racial problems, though they probably existed without my knowledge. As a new kid in a strange new environment, I didn't say much and had few friends and no enemies.  At 74, I feel like I have lived in a bubble which has just been burst, though I don't know how to improve the racist world at this point. There are very few Blacks in the part of New England where I live, though I do interact a little with Latinos. It helps that I took Spanish when we lived in California for 15 years.I hope you can find a way to have your own hugely successful company in a field you love, with equality and respect for all your employees.\",\n",
       "   'This book was absolutely triggering for me. Too many of the stories were the same stories I went through and too many of the feelings I also felt growing up. I grew up half black, living most of my life with my white mom and a mostly absent African father. So we are not the same token black girl and yet we are. I am thankful I never went through the eating disorders, but I have friends who did and I know this will be a hard read for them. But I think it’s one that we ALL should read.I had to take a break from this book for a few weeks and come back, determined to see it through. There are too many uncomfortable truths in this book and I had to decide to get through them. I probably need therapy to deal with all the trauma from racism I’ve had to face in my life, but I honestly don’t think I’m quite ready to confront it all head on.Anyhow, whether I agree or disagree with the things Danielle says, I realize that systemic racism is a problem we have to keep confronting every day we live, if we want to leave the world a better place. I appreciated her candidness, the way she took ownership of her choices and the way she is seeking healing. I hope that others find the opportunity to read and reflect in the points and problems addressed in this book and work in their own lives to overcome the overt racism that media constantly shoves down our throats.',\n",
       "   \"As a biracial person, I found this book... oh, how to describe this... accurate from both sides of the racial line & my family tree. I've been the Token Black Girl in white spaces and the Token White Girl in black spaces, so I couldn't wait to see what this book had to say. Some of the author's work experiences were similar to my own in the corporate world. The author and I are somewhat close in age, so many of her school-aged cultural references brought back a lot of memories. Her insights into the racial aspects of media and fashion were equally informative and saddening. Her self-awareness is inspiring. You can see the hard work she has done to better herself. Bravo! Lastly, she makes a lot of suggestions on how to improve racial equality - I deeply value her efforts here. She didn't just write about all that is imbalanced, she wrote about possible solutions to bring harmony. I rarely give 5 stars, but I believe this book deserves 7 stars. The extra 2 stars are for the solutions, and the vunerability of sharing her mental health struggles. PS The author reads the Audible version, which made it feel like a conversation versus a book. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!\"]},\n",

No stone is left unturned, no one person or entity is to blame and there is factual evidence to being about every opinion Smith made in the narration of the Zaandam, a Holland America (owned by Carnival Cruise Lines) ship that departed from Buenos Aires in early March 2020, about the time the coronavirus was spreading across the globe.Not only are the journalistic aspects of this book outstanding, but so is the humanity. One can’t help but feels for the passengers and crew members portrayed in this book. That is the case whether they were infected with the virus or not. A few of the people will have a god conclusion to this nightmarish voyage, but many will not. Reading this now, nearly 3 years after the event, it’s easy to think ‘if only they knew what we know now” one will see the mistakes made. But given the lack of knowledge, especially out at sea, it is understandable even though some of the actions had disastrous results. But a reader will also be very angry with the various governments and bureaucracies- it felt like they forgot there were sick and dying people on those ships, not just carriers of some scary virus. Highly recommended reading.',\n",

My hope is that the cruise ship industry has learned from the tragedies of COVID and will have new systems in place for future outbreaks or other such catastrophes at sea.Reading the story of quarantine certainly brought back my own tiny experience with COVID quarantine at home.  Stories like this one will go down in the history books for future generations as a genuine slice of what it was really like to live through a worldwide pandemic.',\n",

Yet, in 2022, people are back on cruise ships and they dump the sick and infected into communities when allowed to do so.',\n",

This book gives an in-depth look at what happened on the Zaandam as country after country refused to allow it to dock in March/April2020 as governments tried to keep their countries Covid free (an impossible goal).  The book is extremely well written and took me back emotionally to what it felt like during the early days of the pandemic.  I cried for many of the personal stories told of crew and passengers.  The book gives an interesting look into all the personal, political and diplomatic efforts that finally allowed cruise ships to dock and discharged passengers and crews.',\n",

Bridget was fortunate not to fall prey to a number of situations and maladies that plagued the poor. With hard work and sacrifice, she forged a life for her and her children after the death of her husband at a young age. She didn’t know that she had begun an American dynasty. This book is an interesting account of the humble beginnings of an American version of royalty. Yet another wonderful history book that isn’t taught in many schools.',\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"Summary: Paris Daillencourt’s flatmate signed him up for the hit baking show Bake Expectations, and so he finds himself in the GBBO-like competition. But he’s suffering through sever undiagnosed anxiety, so he’s sure he’s going to make a mess of things with the competition and with his cute fellow competitor, Tariq Hassan.Review: I don’t think Alexis Hall can write a bad book. His writing is beautiful: it’s insightful, funny, poignant, and just really well crafted. HIs characters have depth and unique personalities—he really shines with the side characters. This is true for all of Hall’s books that I’ve read, and this one is no different.It’s odd because reading this story was difficult, and I sometimes didn’t like Paris or Tariq. But having finished it, I have these soft, affectionate feelings towards them. Paris wants to do the right thing but his anxiety keeps him so focused on himself that he can’t see how selfish he’s being. But underneath that is a funny, sweet man. And Tariq has a natural kindness and a wonderfully accepting nature—he’s pure sunshine.And yet, I can’t quite decide if I enjoyed this book or not. I mean, I did. For all of the above reasons. But this is a surprisingly difficult book. It’s marketed as a contemporary romance, a romcom even. And there are plenty of funny moments. And there is a romance running through it. But I have to agree with the other reviewers who pointed out that the main focus seems to be more on Paris’ mental health than on the romance. The two are inextricably linked because there is no way for Paris to be in a healthy relationship while his anxiety is untreated, so I can see that this is still a romance even with the mental illness plot. But Paris’ anxiety almost overwhelms the story.There were times when being in Paris’ POV (which we always are because this is a single POV story) was almost too much to bear. On multiple occasions I was almost in tears from the weight of Paris’ anxiety. I’m sure this is, in a way, a tribute to Hall’s ability to show Paris’ anxiety and how it affects his thoughts and behaviors. He convey’s Paris’ anxiety and the hopeless and helpless feelings that accompany it so well that I was feeling it too. And it wasn’t enjoyable—not that it should be. It’s just not what I usually go to a romcom for.Also, I was a little bothered by how focused Tariq was on how Paris looks. I know Tariq was good about standing up for himself when he felt Paris was being insensitive or hurtful, but it almost seemed like the only reason he wanted to be with Paris was because Paris was good-looking. And then there was the whole thing about Paris being rich. It felt as if Tariq was always holding Paris’ wealth against him even though Paris was born into it and was trying not to be an entitled jerk about it, even when he was unconsciously leaning on it. I’m sure there was some point about being self-aware and not trying to buy approval or something, but it came off more as if Tariq was being judgmental, as if he expected Paris to apologize for his wealth and upbringing. I mean, Paris couldn’t even recount a childhood memory without Tariq making it seem as if Paris were trying to rub his wealth in Tariq’s face. If you spent a vacation in Italy as a child, how can you convey that memory without talking about where you were? Is Paris just never supposed to talk about his past? What I’m saying is, if this supposed to be some sort of critique of class disparities, it doesn't work as well as it did in Rosaline Palmer Takes the Cake.So yeah. It’s a really well written book. But I have mixed emotions. It was fun to be on the set of Bake Expectations again and see Grace, Marianne, Wilford, Jennifer and Colin again. The side characters were all really fun. Tariq’s dad was a kick. I wish I had a friend like Morag—she’s a hoot and is super fierce. And no matter what, I’m glad Paris got his HFN. In the end, I do have fond feeling for this story.Note: this is a non-steamy read\",\n",
       "   \"The writing is beautiful, the romance is sweet, you can see why the characters are drawn together, and what pulls them apart, (and reunites them). There's moments of levity for sure, and the side characters and observations really bring humor to the book.But the absolute star of the book is the depiction of living with generalized anxiety disorder. Reading Paris's perspective was like being back inside my own head before I got medication. Which was hard, not gonna lie. I don't think I've ever read something that so thoroughly captured the all-encompassing nature of anxiety, how it blots out everything good and takes over your life and spirals itself bigger and bigger. How it lies, how it picks at you, the endless what-ifs, the catastrophizing that feels probable, and the resulting paralysis. The absolute certainty that everything good is a temporary fluke, that everything bad is deserved, that people who like you have been fooled, and one day they'll realize the truth. The desperate conflict-avoidance that only causes conflict. And overall, how hopeless everything feels. This is who you are, so you don't deserve help until you fix yourself. Other people have it worse and so you don't need meds, you just need to try harder and not inflict your whining on them. How dare you.Gods, it's all there. And it was so so hard to read. It was hard remembering being that person and having everyone around me telling me that life wasn't supposed to be this hard. That I could get help. That medication might help me more than therapy alone did. That maybe I wasn't saying enough to my therapist about how life felt and how I couldn't get out of my own way.Ultimately, I'm glad I read this book. It reminded me how far I've come. How much medicine has done for me in taking my anxiety levels down a few rungs (it's still there) and allowing me to have other emotions. How supportive my people are. And I think this book will do a lot do show people living with anxiety that there is help -- the kind Paris eventually gets with managing his anxiety better through medication and therapy -- so he can have the life he wants with his schooling and his partner. And it will do a lot for people who just don't understand why it's so much harder for some of us. Sometimes, our brains just really, chemically hate us.\",\n",
       "   'I loved the way this book started, but it went sort of downhill for me after a while.At the beginning, Paris comes across as somewhat \"quirky.\" But after reading a few chapters, his severe mental problems - much deeper than quirkiness - soon become apparent. Reading his extended inner monologues and watching his horrible depression and nearly horrible self-effacement as well as dealing with the [too] many characters really weighed this reader down. Oh! So many characters!I was truly pulling for him for about the first third of the book; and for Tariq as well. But I, as the reader, can only do so much in my imagination. Paris actually DOES \"crumble\" before our eyes :-/I really couldn\\'t feel the romantic \"chemistry\" between Paris and Tariq. It COULD have been there but for Paris\\'s many issues and Tariq\\'s very set \"old-fashioned\" values. On the other hand, I loved some of the side characters like Tariq\\'s less \"old-fashioned\" father and Morag, Paris\\'s snarky, witty housemate (who lives in Paris\\'s \"deluxe\" London apartment for nearly free!).But these two, along with a very few other minor actors, are not enough to rescue the book from a plethora of characters.Toward the end of the book, soon after signing up for therapy (at the near insistence of Tariq and Morag), Paris\\'s mental state does start improving.But, for me, it was too little; too late :-/I don\\'t think I\\'ll be reading the other books in the \"Winner Bakes All\" series.']},\n",

       "   'It’s true. Raymond Chandler and Kurt Vonnegut made a baby. And its name is Sleepwalk. From the first few pages, I was enthralled by author Dan Chaon’s ability to create an antihero of such depth—such longing—that I nearly forgot Will Bear is a sociopath. Yeah. Among his many side jobs, he kills people.As you wend your way through the backroads of a slightly futuristic America, you realize that the person Billy is was mainly due to his random, haphazard childhood. That and a sometime mom who herself had sociopathic tendencies. Like his mother, when the protagonist takes someone out, it’s not personal. Instead, it’s necessary.When Will learns that he might have a biological daughter, things get even more interesting as the revelation turns his world upside down. There were times when I pictured the character as Philip Marlowe chasing down clues. Other times, I recalled some of the funniest moments in novels, such as Player Piano and Cat’s Cradle. But hey, that’s me.Sleepwalk is a hard book to categorize. If I had to sum it up, I’d say it’s crime fiction with some laughs, mainly at Will’s expense. And like him, the other characters are as real as they get. Truthfully, though, The novel is not for everyone. Just saying.If you’re into authors who write to market, then this book may not seem like a slam dunk. But, on the other hand, if you give it a chance, I promise it will open your eyes to addictive storytelling that doesn’t play by the rules. If there was a way, I’d give this book six stars.',\n",
       "   'I bought \"Sleepwalk\"  based on Amazon\\'s recommendation and while I enjoyed the beginning and the main character I thought the book dragged.  The premise was great but I just could not get into it after the first 100 pages as nothing really happened.  Lots of drugs, trips down memory lane, etc., but a coherent story that was interesting?  No.  \"Trippy\" is a good word to describe the book and while that\\'s NOT a bad thing it just wasn\\'t for me.  I get why people like it so I\\'m not going to pan it since I loved the authors \"Ill Will\" but it seemed to me that the plot just meandered... and meandered... and meandered.  To each his own, though!',\n",
       "   'Dan Chaon is a singular and important voice in American fiction, exploring in his unmistakable tone and style themes of family, connection, the inner workings of personal identity, the corrosive power of technology, and our country\\'s increasingly troubling turns toward corporatization, radicalization, and paranoia. This latest book is his best yet. Will \"Billy\" Bear - who goes by too many aliases to count - is an operative for a vast criminal syndicate with the deliciously mundane name of Value Standard Enterprises. He roams the country in a camper van, his only companion a scarred-up pitbull that he rescued from a dogfighting ring, taking calls and jobs of varying levels of criminality from a plethora of burner phones, and the \"Friends\" of the syndicate who know how to reach him. Into this lonely vigil, however, comes the voice of a young woman named Cammie who claims to be his daughter - but is she real, or is it just another deadly trap being laid for a man who has stayed assiduously \"off the grid\" his entire life? As Billy tries to sort out the truth there, and the uncomfortable truths of the near-future dystopia he lives in, the story only gets better, and weirder, and more compelling. And somehow, through all of this dysfunction, immorality, and technological squalor, the author finds a way to deservedly pluck our heartstrings as well.']},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['A book with a title like NSFW is practically daring you to read it, especially at work. YOLO. But NSFW is more than a book with a buzzy title; it\\'s also an incredibly ambitious and timely novel about rape culture, and what working in Hollywood was like prior to the widespread progression of the #MeToo movement in 2017 following the Harvey Weinstein allegations.The heroine in NSFW is never named, but she\\'s a young Jewish girl living in Hollywood. Her mother was a feminist lawyer famous for taking on rape cases and empowering women to confront their attackers, but now she\\'s having an existential crisis, hover parenting her adult daughter while self-medicating with expensive beauty treatments and questionably prescribed medications. She is good for one thing, though: her connections. She\\'s old friends with a higher-up at a production studio and is able to finagle our protagonist a job.Our heroine quickly proves herself competent and a little cut-throat. She\\'s insecure but willing to do what needs to be done, and she knows who her allies are. Which is why it\\'s so shocking to her when quiet whispers begin to circulate about certain men in the studio taking advantage of their power to get what they want from the women who work there. She feels valued, and respected (mostly), so surely those other women can\\'t be right? Maybe they did something or maybe they misunderstood the situation. Those are the lies we tell ourselves to believe that we\\'re safe. But in a culture that discourages victims from speaking out and places the burden of proof and the brunt of the blame on the wronged, nobody is ever really safe.I LOVED this book, okay? I can\\'t believe people aren\\'t talking about it. Or that the ratings are so low! No, this isn\\'t a book with a neat and tidy ending, and often it feels bleak, but the way it captures workplace culture and the so-called post-sexism culture of the early 2010s, when people felt way too optimistic about the all too grim future, is pitch-perfect. The heroine is believably flawed, and I feel like her struggle to come to terms with her own internalized misogyny and the way that she labors under her mother\\'s mixed messages and emotional abuse are so well done. Feminism isn\\'t a set of clear-cut principles and it\\'s a constant journey of self-betterment, so I love seeing books that tackle the process of going through that legwork. It\\'s also just a really good and gossipy story that\\'s hard to put down. In some ways, it reminded me a lot of another \"flawed feminist\" book I just read, POST-TRAUMATIC.P.S. The blurb says that this is a debut work, but it isn\\'t. The author published a previous book in 2007, also set in LA. After reading this one, I may have to buy it. It\\'s YA but it looks like it\\'s on the more mature end of the YA spectrum.4.5 to 5 out of 5 stars',\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"I read it for the reading challenge. I did appreciate the first half of the book where she details her struggles as a mom, wife, and author. I can empathize with some of her struggles and even a bit of the journey to overcome them. No one talks about the hardships of being a modern mother without anyone around to help you through this brand new experience of raising a child. We are just supposed to know what to do and have our entire lives together in the meantime. Enter anxiety and depression and all the fun things that come with them. This book digs into that part of motherhood and I was so relieved to read that I wasn't alone in feeling these things. Now, the part where she attempted to weave in the healing aspect of horses was a little harder for me to get into. I AM a horse girl and I have been since I was a child. I guess my disconnect to the author is her fear of the animal and her unwillingness to be the leader in any horse and rider relationship that she had. So while she did learn some valuable lessons like confidence, relaxing, having fun, and getting in shape, she still never changed that dynamic. Her last horse story was about being run away with on a borrowed mare and a string of ponies. To me, I don't think she ever really learned what she needed to because she STILL struggles with that fear of horses after all those years. Anyway, the second half of this book was pretty discombobulated, and she ended it like she just gave up on figuring out the best conclusion for it. Like a rage-quit kind of thing. I get that it was so hard to put all of this down on paper, for the public to read, but I think this book deserved more attention to the last half. I'd give it three and a half out of five stars. At least it's a short book.\",\n",
       "   'This memoir opens in 2016 when Maum was thirty-seven years old and her daughter two. Her debut novel had been published the year her daughter was born, but her second novel, which was under contract, was due soon. Then it was late. The demands of care for her two-year-old had become consuming and frustrating. Her relationship with her husband was strained. Insomnia muddled everything. The overdue draft had two horse people characters:  a dressage champion and his racehorse-breeding mother. The novel was about the experience of touch deficit in a tech mediated digital age. What were these horse people doing in the draft? Maum knew the novel wasn’t working, but she didn’t want to cut these characters. She drove two hours into northern Massachusetts from her home in the Berkshires, for research, to interview a famous dressage trainer. There she found herself being pulled back into relationship with horses, an orbit she’d left nearly thirty years earlier. The Year of the Horses tells the story of how Maum’s renewed connections with horses and related changes in herself saved her marriage—she confesses to having been unfaithful—how they saved her relationship with her daughter, her own mental health, and her writing.—Maum’s debut novel was the inaptly titled I’m Having So Much Fun Here Without You (2014, Touchstone, 331pp.). The novel is about estrangement, the male narrator’s infidelity, and the psychological and interpersonal struggle to recover.\"I married my lover, time turned her into my sister. Truly, badly, I want my lover back. But we’ve twisted each other with our unspoken failures and our building scorn.\"In this novel, Maum gave a nuanced, sympathetic portrayal of her unfaithful protagonist.—The central storyline of The Year of the Horses moves through 2016 into 2018, from the opening scene, before Maum’s reunion with horses, until after she had gained basic proficiency in the dangerous sport of polo. The narrative weaves in strands from Maum’s childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Horse people and others who have known closeness with non-human mammals will resonate with this story. And the horses are not merely incidental. But running through the narrative is Maum’s perceptive reflection on her past and her generosity toward…well, really everyone a lesser person might have blamed for her struggles. Instead, she blames herself, and then shows us how to move beyond that.\"What was I so furious about? Why did I hate my mellow husband? Leo had some serious spatial awareness issues…and a selective attention span, but he was a good father and a dedicated one, tireless in fact…. Our sensual life had dwindled to once-in-a-blue-moon physical communions that made me feel embarrassed, but when I turned the tables, what desire did I show him? What efforts was I making? How come everything was Leo’s fault all the time?\"—When Maum was six years old, her parents finally gave in to her pleas for a horse. She rode for three glorious years, changing horses as her skills developed and she won ribbons and trophies for her riding and jumping. But her little brother’s illness, and her parents’ fracturing marriage and divorce, brought the riding to a halt when she was nine years old. Maum struggled with insomnia as a child and as an adolescent with anorexia. When the memoir begins, she is mired in a severe depression—and pulled by a longing to be loved, touched, known.—Maum’s second novel, Touch (2017, Putnam, 303pp.) prompts more LOLs than her debut. With playful humor and satirical elements, it is set in the near future where high tech is ascendant. The protagonist, Sloane, is a thirty-something trend forecaster who has opted not to have children. At a point when she has become conflicted about her own touch deficit, she proposes to her boss, offhandedly, that his tech company could produce “empathy tots” for the childless. “‘[Robotic] Kids you can turn on and off,’” because childless people are touched less often. Touch is about the desire to recover physical closeness, to pull back from having only digital contact with virtual connections. Maum’s first two novels are not about loss. They begin when the loss has already happened. Both are about the possibility of a recovery of closeness: in a marriage and in the larger culture of digitally mediated connection.—In The Year of the Horses, Maum addresses several challenges, for instance:  How to be a professionally accomplished person who is also mother to a strong-willed, curious child. How to be an artist married to another but different sort of artist. And how to accept, as a perfectionist, becoming only tolerably good at a sport that she played for fun. In these and other ways, she needed to do better for her husband and daughter than she had experienced as a child.\"I had never thought about how upset it made me that whether I was at my mother’s or my father’s, my parents let me hurt myself, how unloved it made me feel, until my therapist asked me if my parents had shown me any neglect.\"Once, when the deadline for the second novel was closing in, she and her family took a vacation while living and working in France. Maum recalled:\"I wanted to be kind. I wasn’t. Looking back with the lens of years between me and that arid property, I see now that I wasn’t able to vacation because I’d cut myself off from the possibility that a family could bring joy. Work brought joy, and because the writing wasn’t going well, there could be no joy.\"—Maum’s third novel, Costalegre, (2019, Tin House, 218pp.), breaks from her first two, both of which work well as audiobooks. Plot has gone almost silent. This novel is both less “realistic” and less hopeful than her first two. But there is a through line. Lara, the narrator, has just turned fifteen years old. She has come with her American heiress mother, Leonora Calaway (based on Peggy Guggenheim), to a coastal Mexican jungle. Leonora brought seven avant-garde painters and writers she rescued from pre-World War II Europe. The novel consists of diary entries:  letters, reflections on people and events, lists of likes and dislikes, notes about lush vegetation and flowers, descriptions of dreams, etc. The narrative that does emerge, though, has the following threads:  Leonora and her surrealists are waiting anxiously for a ship smuggling the paintings she collected in Europe for her planned museum. She is attending more to her “rescues” and their current work than to her daughter. She hasn’t arranged for a tutor for Lara. Leonora hardly notices when Lara is absent. Lara becomes infatuated with an artist not of their group. That fictional character represents the historical Constantin Brancusi, sculpting in the novel even though the surrealists at Leonora’s house think he has stopped working. Brancusi was fifty-two years old when Hitler and Nazi troops marched into Austria, halfway into the novel. Lara aches over Leonora’s maternal neglect, and she chafes at the older artist’s responses to her attentions. She desires deeply to be loved, touched, known.—One of the most enjoyable chapters in The Year of the Horses occurs late in the memoir. It seems almost irrelevant to the larger story about horses. Maum convinced her reluctant husband they should adopt, sight unseen, a rescue cat that turns out to have been, not a kitten, as advertised, but a four-year-old who had been abused and abandoned. Maum tells the story of picking it up and bringing it home and how they dealt with the effects of its traumas. This chapter is a delight. Maum here and throughout this memoir is funny and heartwarming without being sentimental. And this apparently irrelevant chapter hits what may be the main theme of the memoir: How do we make mistakes? And how do we recover from them without making things worse?—Maum’s most recent book before this memoir compiles advice for debut authors nearing the publishing process. Its title gives a preview of the book’s comprehensiveness: Before and After The Book Deal: A Writer’s Guide to Finishing, Publishing, Promoting, and Surviving Your First Book (2020, Catapult, 347pp.). This handbook is encyclopedic. Debut authors would have almost no way of knowing many of its details. As a reference work, it can supply an overview but is probably most useful a chapter at a time, when writers are at the relevant stage in their process. One hundred and ninety-six writers and publishing professionals are listed in an appendix as interviewed and/or quoted.—WARNING:  There are a couple of heartbreaks late in The Year of the Horses. I took them pretty hard. I wanted Maum to get sentimental, and she didn’t do it. So I got sentimental on my own, in the privacy of my reading this wonderful memoir. Maum’s renewed love of horses is the centerstage story, but its unmistakable backdrop is her generous nature, her sense of humor, her keen self-awareness, and her love of life. She takes us through her “unrelenting, steely-nerved perfectionism” and the many ways she has been too hard on herself, through her generosity to all those in her life she might have blamed, to the best to which most of us mortals can aspire:  a healthy if imperfect life.',\n",
       "   'Courtney Maum\\'s first memoir is a must-read. From the minute it was delivered until I finished it, I couldn\\'t put it down. I\\'m normally an ebook reader, but I ordered the hardcover. I\\'m glad I did because the 80s nostalgia was strong. I marked up the margins with notes & stars instead of highlighting in Kindle.Her recollection of personal experiences (both the wins & losses) throughout her childhood, teens, and adulthood spoke true to me. We\\'ve actually lived in the same areas, so I felt my own nostalgia reading her stories (I was actually pregnant in Paris & New England at the same time). Don\\'t worry if you haven\\'t because she beautifully describes all her locations so to bring you into her own memories (think Dumbledore\\'s Pensieve).Although I\\'m not a \"horse girl\"...more like a \"car girl\" or \"cat lady\", I loved learning all about horses...specifically the women polo players. I\\'m definitely going to quote \"SHOULDERS LIKE A QUEEN, HIPS LIKE A WHORE!\" whenever I need to readjust myself.I found this memoir to be full of courage, bravery, and honesty (even alluding to her own narrator bias). I can only hope that her experiences and story help others to find ways to prioritize their own self-care and mental health.Throughout my teens and occasionally as a young adult I would play tennis. Two summers ago I started teaching one of my children but recently started to take lessons again on my own. Tennis to me is what horses are to Maum: something joyful that is completely my own. It challenges and delights me. If you like those two things, then you should read THE YEAR OF THE HORSES as soon as possible.',\n",
       "   'I was immediately drawn in by this title. As a rider myself I understand the deep healing and connection one can find in the equine world. As I made my way through this deeply felt and succinctly communicated memoir, I felt the heart and soul of a woman on the brink, searching. She is recognizable in her struggles with depression, motherhood, and seeking her own identity.I loved this memoir and the reminder of our connection to one another and to the animals we love. The 80s references definitely added to the allure for me (especially Lisa Frank). Ha',\n",

The more I read, the more intrigued I became. The book became impossible to put down. I stayed up past midnight reading it. It was much better than I thought it would be. There were twists that surprised me. It is with that in mind that I would suggest you skip the reviews and just get the book. Oh! By the end of the book, I did come to appreciate Grace.\",\n",
       "   'I was very interested in the book because of the cover and the title. Big letters and a black and pink cover screamed at me as I browsed for books. It looked like a promising story. And for the most part, it delivered an entertaining read.Grace, a twenty-something, currently in jail for murder, tells her story of how she has committed multiple murders, but not the murder she is currently in jail for.The plot intrigued me. Each murder she planned and committed took its time, some much longer than others. But it was clear to me that a lot of thought and detail went into that part of the story. Grace has her reasons and makes sure she has her opportunity. One by one she can cross a name off her kill-list.I enjoyed the story, and I had fun reading about Grace\\'s journey. I especially liked the planning and the executing of her plans, but I did not really like her other \"normal\" life stuff.And then came the final chapters of the story. The part where it is made clear why she is in prison and the conclusion of her story. I didn\\'t like those parts. I would have liked a different ending, but it didn\\'t end well for me to give it more than 3 stars.',\n",

Why does a man always have to ruin a woman's good time? I can see this book turned into a Hulu limited series special. If you need a beach read, this is your book.\",\n",

       "  'reviews': ['I struggled with how to rate thus book.  I wanted to give it 3 1\\\\2 stars but had to round up to four. First, the cover, does this book a great disservice.  I read the book in response to one of the Kindle challenges. None of the books really spoke to me and I chose this one because it was on sale for $2.99.  I would never have paid the full asking price for an unknown to me author and would normally never  even looked at the synopsis because I judged it on the cover.  I only found the book because it was required reading and it was the cheapest option.I liked the story. I really enjoyed the text conversations between the main character and the love interest.  But, I ended up skimming most of the last half of the book.  I think it\\'s my fault not the authors because the book was well written  in general hence the 4 stars.  I did have issues with the overall feel and flow of the book but can\\'t report them without spoilers.Spoilers below.............I found the book... Depressing?  I\\'m not sure that\\'s the right response.  It has a happy ending.  But, I read for escapism. This book just kept making me sad.  The dying grandmother with memory issues, the cheating father, the money and housing issues,  the sadness and emotional toil was real and it just kept building.I reached my breaking point when the main character and her father had a massive fight over money and long term care of the grandmother in FRONT of her.  Later the grandmother attempts suicide and gets significantly worse memory wise.  That punch is followed by the heroine not winning a award she expected, meeting the hero face to face  for the \"first\" time and having an epic fight over the lies both had told. Then the best friend telling her she didn\\'t get the movie role she expected because basically she wasn\\'t disfigured as much or as popular as someone else and the heroine having another epic fight with the friend.  It was to much....  I started  skipping and never looked backMy third issue is the heroine lost her on screen acting career after walking into a air plane propeller.  She has a scar on her face and lost an eye and her shoulder was also damaged. The story was just a little to close to the actual story of a model who was injured in a similar situation.  We find out the story of her injury about half way through the book.  From that point on I had the real life incident and individual in mind and couldn\\'t separate it from the fictional heroine.Then the author doubles down by having the heroine lose the acting role the friend arranged for her to get back into the business to ... wait for it....  A young social media star who lost her arm to a shark attack at 16.  Once again the similarity to actual events and individuals completely jarred me out of the story.I believe most of my issues are my own and not a technical flaw of the authors. However, I\\'m writing a review for readers and know that many readers are like me and may be overwhelmed by the suffering and drama in the book.  I normally read urban fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, and some romance.  The book does have romance and a happy ending it\\'s just really rough getting there.',\n",
       "   \"I have always loved listening to Whelan narrate books and I have listened to A LOT of them. So it was a no brainer to pick up this book.(kindle) She writes with an easy pace. And even as romancey as this book is it's GOOD! A genre I don't typically read but this year I have been switching things up and this book is a great one. Can't wait for a movie adaptation!!Someone buy me a physical copy of this please? I'll send you my address :)\",\n",
       "   'THANK YOU FOR LISTENING is about a an audio book narrator, Sewanee, that started out on steamy romances and eventually became the go to voice for best sellers and nonfiction.  On the other side of the story is a male romance narrator Brock McNight much sought after mystery man in the audiobook world.But they come from circumstances that have broken them.  The secondary characters in the story - best friends, Nick, Sarah, Alice, grandmother, parents, employers, etc. all have their hope of helping the broken characters mend but it’s ultimate up to them to figure out what is holding them back.It’s a well written story with just the right amount of teases and twists to keep me turning the pages.  Our main characters are complex, flawed and so interesting.  Good book.',\n",
       "   'Loved it.  Loved hearing about the technical aspects of audiobooks…and Swan’s use and understanding of the English language.  Loved the emotional ups and downs of the book.  My only criticism is, I thought the last 15-20% dragged a bit…but to be fair, that part was necessary to wrap up all the details in the story.',\n",
       "   \"Julia Whelan is a highly respected audiobook narrator and this book uses that as a starting point. I'm not a romance reader but this feels like a very sweet romance to me. She takes the tropes and gives them a spin. She also has another novel that I haven't read.\",\n",

       "   \"This is my first book by this author and I've heard good things about this book. It was a good read. I loved that it is about audiobook narrators.Sewanee is such an interesting character. She's had an accident when she was an actress that led her to narrating audiobooks. Her backstory is interesting and you find out more and more as you read. I love her friendship with Adaku and her love for her grandmother was touching. I have to admit I got frustrated with her by the middle of the book. Her reactions to Nick and their one night stand at the beginning of the book was understandable. I felt her reactions to the revelation of who Brock was and the crazy coincidences was a bit harsh. I did enjoy the last quarter of this book and her time with her mother.I loved the messages between Sewanee and Brock in the beginning as they work on narrating a book together. When they finally meet, it was everything I hoped for and more.The last part of the book definitely made the story for me. There was actual growth between both Nick and Sewanee towards the end of the book. It was a good ending.Overall, I enjoyed this book and the concept of the story. It was different and interesting to see the behind the scenes look of audiobook narrating. It was a good romance read that has all the tropes.\"]},\n",

       "  'reviews': ['N. Jamiyla Chisholm was only two-years-old when her mother quit her job and converted to Islam while joining her husband in what was considered to be an exclusive Muslim society in Brooklyn.The warm, affectionate, and seemingly devoted mother that Jamiyla had known up to that point would change once they entered the doors of this \"community,\" a place where Jamiyla would be separated from her mother for extended periods of time and where she would be placed under the care of disciplinarian \"ums\" who quickly grew tired of her emotional neediness and persistent desire to see her mother. Dwight York, also known as the self-proclaimed Imam Isa, would, as is nearly always true of cults, exact absolute control within this community and instead of a spiritual haven this community became a place of controlled abuse and unspeakable secrets.40 years later, Jamiyla needed to resolve her issues around this experience and this resolution, of course, ended up in her telling the story through this book. While her mother, Ummi, had no desire to return to this place it was, at least on some level, an honoring of her daughter\\'s needs that she at least seems to have partially participated in the writing of this book.\"The Community\" is Jamiyla\\'s story of her family\\'s life inside and outside this cult and the aftermath of life for the fracturing of the family and the years that would follow including the impact of 9/11. The film is a journey through Black history and identity and also one of the personal betrayals that are so often a part of life inside a cult.\"The Community\" was an Amazon First Read during the month of May 2022 in advance of its June 1st release.A journalist by profession now, Chisholm has crafted a story here that weaves together both her personal memories and her interviews with some of those involved in this journey. While much of \"The Community\" reads as if it is all her memory, a weakness in the writing, the truth is that closer review does reveal it\\'s not always told through the voice of her childhood lens. Part of the difficulty with the book is that while it occasionally offers great detail of Chisholm\\'s own insights and feelings during this time, it seldom offers much in the way of insights into life inside this cult or the actual aftermath of being under the control of a man who would eventually be convicted of racketeering, child sexual abuse, rape, conspiracy, and fraud and sentenced to 135 years.This makes sense, of course, since much of the story is coming from someone who was a child during these years and actually was not privy to much of this information. While she knew that she didn\\'t have access to her mother or father, she didn\\'t necessarily know why or where they actually were during these times. She knew that she was supervised by disciplinarians who seemed to have an abusive disdain for her, but she knew very little about the organizational structure of this cult.In other words, there was a lot that Chisholm didn\\'t know about The Community and that lack of knowledge hinders a full-on immersion into this book that offers more casual reflections than actual in-depth insights.As someone who grew up similarly in a cult, though not a Muslim one, I\\'m in many ways the target reader for this book (though I do believe it\\'s much more targeting Black readers). However, I had a hard time connecting with the material and often felt like Chisholm\\'s ongoing lack of resolution radiates throughout the pages. While there\\'s certainly no obligation to write an inspirational story or happy ending, especially if there isn\\'t particularly one, there is a necessity to write a story that somehow engages with the reader. I struggled with that engagement here but still felt tremendous empathy for this child who has been so deeply wounded, and in some ways appears to be still so deeply wounded, by the actions of her parents.The politicization in the book, which is especially prominent toward the book\\'s end, is certainly important in terms of cultural insight but feels extraneous within the context of this memoir that has up until this angle is introduced been exclusively about this cult and the fractures within Chisholm\\'s family. It was introduced abruptly and isn\\'t fully fleshed out enough to be truly effective.Overall, I more appreciated \"The Community\" than enjoyed it and never really felt like I gained insights into this cult, these people, or even how all of this has shaped Chisholm\\'s life journey now. Basic facts, such as how long they were actually in the cult and a timeline for it, are largely ignored here in favor of a tapestry feelings over facts. The feelings are certainly important in giving this story emotional resonance, however, I came away from the experience largely dissatisfied emotionally and intellectually. Interestingly enough, at one point it occurred to me that Chisholm largely writes here like she reports experiencing her childhood - emotionally detached and with a tremendous wall that keeps things from going deeper.The end result is a book that is modestly engaging yet never completely immersive. \"The Community\" is a book that tells a harrowing story yet never actually feels harrowing. It\\'s a book that wants us to understand one child\\'s experiences and how that experience and culture shaped her, yet Chisholm still seems hesitant to fully reveal those experiences and that culture.The compound for the United Nation of Nuwaubians has long been torn down. Obviously, the impact of its presence lingers on in the memories, wounds, and scars of those men, women, and children who were impacted by their years of involvement. While \"The Community\" may not have quite the impact one would have hoped, it\\'s still an important and revealing story with hope and a long due healing between a daughter and the mother she never completely understood.',\n",
       "   'I listened to the audio version of this book and found it to be very interesting. I think that it had the potential to be excellent, but there were a few areas in the story that needed to be tightened up and explained further. The last few pages of the book did that and talked about the underlying theme of love, but I think that could have been incorporated throughout the book. Nevertheless, it is an interesting story.',\n",
       "   \"Overall I enjoyed this book. I found myself wanting to read or listen in chunks and then taking time to allow the material to absorb. This book deals with heavy topics in many layers. I struggled during the telling of the author's experiences at The Community however. I understand why it was presented the way it was, but retelling such detailed feelings and understandings from the perspective of a 2 year old is unrealistic and it distracted my focus during these parts.This is an important story of enduring trauma, resilience, and hope.\",\n",
       "   'This book was not what I expected from reading the write up. I expected to learn about York and his movement. York is barely mentioned and the movement has very little detail. The book followed a family that had been pulled into the community and all that followed over the next 30 years.',\n",
       "   'A very interesting, yet devastating memoir, that is well written and is a pretty easy read.  I think if you are on the fence about reading it, you should read it. Its good.',\n",
       "   'A recounting of the pain and suffering endured for two years in the Muslim Community of Imam Isa (Dwight York) by the author as a toddler, how it affected her relationship with her mother, and how the relationship was repaired.  Much more about what motivated her parents to enter the Community and become Muslim and the lingering effects of racism and White Supremacy in the USA.',\n",
       "   \"I am always interested in hearing the stories of people's lives and how they become who they are. I somewhat identify with Chisholm in that the church I grew up in was deemed a cult. I didn't know this until I became an adult. Reading her journey made me relive moments that made my heart rate accelerate. Times and incidents that forever shape and scar our lives and yet,  here we are. As frustrating and at times scary as it is, our stories must be told to be kept alive. I am going to look up Dwight York.\",\n",
       "   'From the point of view of a three year old, we jump to talking to her mom about ‘the Community’, a place black Muslims seemed to have been drawn to. It was viewed as a cult later. Of course anytime there’s only one person controlling everything it rife for egotistical people. Ok, Men.To this add feeling alone in a culture to finding a place you hope you can call ’family’. Of course, that’s what gangs do also.Either way I found it an interesting book.']},\n",

       "   'Such Big Dreams is a contemporary fiction novel about a young woman trying to make it on her own in Mumbai.Rakhi is a twenty-three year old orphan and former street kid. After being plucked from a girl’s school as a teenager she is offered a position as an office assistant for a non-profit law firm called Justice For All. Her mentor Gauri pays her a small wage, helps her secure a hut in a slum, and sends her to therapy after she steals an elephant figurine from a wealthy woman’s home. But, Justice for All and Rakhi are headed for a shakeup when Alex, a new intern from Canada arrives. Alex brings with him the attention of a family friend (and former Bollywood actress) which will mean more funding to the struggling non-profit. When Alex discovers that the quiet subservient office girl is also clever and knowledgeable about Mumbai he pays her to show him the city and encourages her to apply to hospitality colleges. But Rakhi’s past and the secrets she’s keeping could bring her world tumbling down on her before she’s had a chance to achieve any of her dreams.Such Big Dreams is a true coming of age tale story set against the dynamic backdrop of Mumbai. I learned so much about the culture of Mumbai, non-profit law, slums and the lives of street children. Rakhi is a fascinating character who isn’t a “too good to be true” Cinderella stand-in but not a villain either. She is a mess of contradictions with a sly sense of humor and her own moral compass.I highly recommend this debut novel from Reema Patel. She’s created both a character you can root along with incredible detail about modern day Mumbai.',\n",
       "   'This is a debut novel that I absolutely enjoyed. Rakhi is a 23 year old former street child that is now working at a civil rights law firm in Bombay. So many subjects were touched on here, I thought they were all very well done and I really learned a lot about India, its culture and the resiliency of its people. The story was captivating, I loved Rakhi and her fierce spirit, both from her time on the streets to her time at the law firm. I loved how she questioned everything but yet still took nothing for granted, and oftentimes she was both misunderstood and very naive and trusting. Alex is a Harvard-educated Canadian that comes to work as an intern and has a LOT to learn but yet still never quite seems to ‘get’ it and I loved that he was also naive and trusting, but learned a hard lesson with that as well. He connects with Rakhi as he helps her get stronger with her English and she helps him learn more about India and its culture.I really loved this story, the characters and the setting were brought to life by Patel’s writing, I could not believe this was a debut. It is heartbreaking at times but also incredibly inspiring. I loved the audiobook for this one, the narrator did an amazing job with the story. I cannot wait to see what Patel writes next, I will definitely be adding it to my list.Thank you to Ballantine Books and NetGalley for the digital copy to review.',\n",
       "   \"There were many times while reading that I just wanted to give up. I am always interested in learning about new cultures but I don't feel I learned anything about India. There was a lot of Hindi words, A LOT, and they never were explained or put into a context where the meaning would reveal itself. It just got frustrating not knowing what was going on, why they called certain people firanghi, why did a lot of words end with wala, etc. I didn't find Rakhi to be very likeable. I understand she was a street kid and didn't trust a lot of people but she did end up in a decent situation. She worked for a lawyer she called Guari Ma'am and some others in Justice for All but none of those characters were really developed. I pushed through and while the ending was satisfying it just felt like a long time to get to.Thank you to Netgalley and Random House Ballantine for providing me with a digital copy.\"]},\n",

I loved the plot centered on writing and the cutthroat publishing industry. It was sweet but not cloying and the dialogue really had me cheering for a happy ending.\\xa0It was predictable but in a comforting way. I smiled throughout the whole read. I also liked the healthy friendship between Izzy and BFF Priya. The book (for the most part) is free from the cattiness and subtle undermining that I feel is really prevalent in romances with strong female leads. Izzy isn\\'t dumb, she\\'s appealingly intelligent, and she stands up for herself, but doesn\\'t ever come across as overbearing or arrogant.Four and a half stars. This is a bookish and fun romance.

The author spent more time explaining Izzy\\'s life and feelings about publishing and writing and editing than she did with flushing out the characters.Yes, with this being a retelling, the main points were obvious. But the wording was pedantic, juvenile, and bland. The snacks were better described than the romance. Has this author even heard of descriptive writing?Bleh. I didn\\'t totally hate this book, because I forced myself to finish it. But, overall, I\\'m very glad I checked it out from the library and didn\\'t pay actual money for this pandering drivel.I\\'ll just reread \"If the Shoe Fits\" when I want a book where the love interests have chemistry together.',\n",
